---

In this activity, we aim to highlight the contributions of women to the field of astronomy. I have provided you with a list containing names and specialties of [remarkable women astronomers](https://storage.googleapis.com/avh-lessons/women-in-astronomy.pdf). Your task is to explore the life and work of one of these astronomers, learning more about her contributions, challenges, and impact on the field.

- **Select an Astronomer:** Browse the spreadsheet and choose one woman astronomer whose work interests you. Aim to select someone who has not yet been covered by your classmates, to ensure a wide range of astronomers are explored.
- **Conduct Research:** Look into her educational background, key discoveries, and any awards or recognitions she has received. Consider also the challenges she may have faced in her career and how she overcame them.
- **Share Your Findings:** Post on the discussion board about the astronomer you researched. Include information about her specialty, significant contributions to astronomy, and any interesting facts or stories you discovered.

As classmates post their findings, read about the diverse array of astronomers featured by your peers. Engage with their posts through comments, expressing what you found intriguing or inspiring about their chosen astronomer.
