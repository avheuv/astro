title: Letter to Santa Discussion
---

This discussion is a little silly, but we're going to take on the perspective of either the Moon or Mercury and write a letter to Santa. What would the Moon or Mercury want for Christmas? Could it be protection from meteor strikes, a wish for more visitors, or perhaps something more whimsical and unexpected? 

- Choose Your Celestial Perspective: Decide whether you'll embody the Moon, Earth's loyal companion, with its stark landscapes and historic footprints, or Mercury, the swift messenger of the solar system, closest to the Sun and enduring extreme temperatures.
- Write Your Letter to Santa:  Channel your chosen celestial body and craft a letter to Santa. Your letter should reflect the personality you imagine for your celestial body, incorporating scientific facts into your creative narrative. Consider their physical features, their role in the solar system, and their metaphorical "feelings" about their existence.
- Share Your Letter: Address your letter to Santa and post it to our course discussion board. 

Now take a moment to step into Santa's boots. Read through one of your classmates' letters and craft a thoughtful response as if you were the jolly old elf himself. How would Santa reply to the wishes and thoughts of the Moon or Mercury? Whether itâ€™s with encouragement, a sprinkle of holiday magic, or a promise of cosmic gifts, let your response reflect Santa's cheerful spirit and kindness.
