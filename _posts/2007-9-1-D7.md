title: Who Owns the Moon Discussion
---

The Moon has captivated human imagination for centuries, but questions about its ownership and use have become more relevant with advancing space exploration. Companies have even claimed to sell lunar land, raising the question of who, if anyone, can own the Moon. 

- **Explore Lunar Ownership:** Start by researching the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. What does this treaty say about nations claiming ownership over territory in space? How does this compare to the historical colonization of territories on Earth?
- **Share Your Perspective:** Post a reflection on the discussion board about whether anyone — countries, companies, or individuals — should be able to stake a claim on the Moon? Consider some of the legal, ethical, or scientific implications of owning or using lunar resources.
- **Engage With Classmates:** After posting, take some time to explore your classmates’ perspectives. Reply to at least one post, discussing similarities or differences in your views of space exploration.

If you're convinced that buying land on the moon is a great idea, then feel free to check out the [Lunar Registry](https://lunarregistry.com/). The last time I checked, you can buy an acre of the moon for just $39.95. (Seriously, though, don't waste your money on this.)
