title: Letter to Santa Discussion
---

 Once you've decided, channel your chosen celestial body's unique traits and experiences into crafting a letter to Santa. What would the Moon or Mercury ask for Christmas? Could it be protection from meteor strikes, a wish for more visitors, or perhaps something more whimsical or unexpected?

- Choose Your Celestial Perspective: Decide whether you'll embody the Moon, Earth's loyal companion, with its stark landscapes and historic footprints, or Mercury, the swift messenger of the solar system, closest to the Sun and enduring extreme temperatures.
- Write Your Letter to Santa:  Channel the essence of your chosen celestial body as you craft a letter to Santa. What might the Moon or Mercury want for Christmas? Do they feel lonely in the vastness of space? Are they proud of their craters and valleys? Your letters should reflect the personality you imagine for your celestial body, incorporating scientific facts into your creative narrative. Consider their physical features, their role in the solar system, and their metaphorical "feelings" about their existence.
- Post Your Letter: Share your letter on the course discussion board. 
 This is an opportunity to combine your knowledge of astronomy with a bit of holiday cheer and creativity.



Post your letter on our course discussion board and prepare to embark on a delightful, festive journey through the solar system. 

After you've posted your cosmic letter to Santa, take a moment to step into Santa's boots. Read through one of your classmates' letters and craft a thoughtful response as if you were the jolly old elf himself. How would Santa reply to the wishes and thoughts of the Moon or Mercury? Whether itâ€™s with encouragement, a sprinkle of holiday magic, or a promise of cosmic gifts, let your response reflect Santa's cheerful spirit and boundless kindness.
