- Explore [29.5 What Is the Universe Really Made Of?](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/29-5-what-is-the-universe-really-made-of) to learn about the composition of the universe, including the role of dark matter and ongoing efforts to detect weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs).
- Read [29.6 The Inflationary Universe](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/29-6-the-inflationary-universe) to understand the concept of inflation, which proposes rapid expansion in the early universe, and its implications for cosmology.
- Review [29.7 The Anthropic Principle](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/29-7-the-anthropic-principle) to explore the idea that fundamental physical constants and laws are finely tuned to allow for the existence of life, leading to discussions about the multiverse hypothesis.
