- Read [11.1 Exploring the Outer Planets](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/11-1-exploring-the-outer-planets) to learn about the exploration of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune by spacecraft like Pioneer, Voyager, Galileo, and Cassini, including the grand tour of the giant planets by Voyager 2.
- Voyager's Grand Tour remains one of the most impressive space missions of all time. Using gravitational assists, Voyager 2 was able to visit all four of the gas giants. Check out the video [Voyager's Grand Tour](https://youtu.be/RvEAks-WLR0) to see the incredible trajectory of the Voyager 2 mission. If you like, you can play with the [Eyes on the Solar System - Voyager's Grand Tour](https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/solar-system/#/story/voyager_grand_tour) simulation for yourself.
- The Cassini Mission to Saturn produced some of the most incredible images of Saturn, it's rings, and moons. Check out this artistic compilation of raw images from the mission set to music: [Cassini Mission](https://vimeo.com/24410924).
- Explore [11.2 The Giant Planets](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/11-2-the-giant-planets) to understand the characteristics of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, including their compositions, internal structures, magnetic fields, and energy sources.
- Review [11.3 Atmospheres of the Giant Planets](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/11-3-atmospheres-of-the-giant-planets) to explore the compositions, cloud layers, atmospheric motions, and major storms on Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
