title: The Birth of Modern Astronomy
---

- Read about the revolutionary shift to heliocentric cosmology in [2.4 The Birth of Modern Astronomy](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/2-4-the-birth-of-modern-astronomy).
- Watch the teacher video [Ptolemy and Copernicus](https://youtu.be/eoJ3w3Sr4Gg?si=mt2Xo17wUHOGaQat), which compares and contrasts the Ptolemaic and Copernican models of our solar system. If you'd like to experiment with the simulations used in this video, you can find them here: [heliocentric model](https://storage.googleapis.com/avh-sims/astroUNL/naap/ssm/heliocentric.html), [retrograde motion](https://storage.googleapis.com/avh-sims/astroUNL/classaction/animations/renaissance/retrograde.html), [epicycles demo](https://storage.googleapis.com/avh-sims/astroUNL/classaction/animations/renaissance/pathtracer.html).
- One argument in favor of the heliocentric model of our solar system is that it is more elegant and simple than a geocentric model. This is beautifully illustrated with [this side-by-side comparison](https://www.malinc.se/math/trigonometry/geocentrismen.php).
- One argument against the heliocentric model is that it is totally insane! I mean, clearly the earth is fixed and the sun moves around it - just look up at the sky! Overcoming this popular view was extremely difficult and arguably represents the first great achievement of moden science.
- Watch the excellent PBS clip [Galileo: Sun-Centered System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdnGE4FPQcE), which shows how Galileo got the idea to examine the Phases of Venus, and what those observations led him to conclude.
- It can be difficult to visualize how the phases of venus prove that the earth isn't at the center of our solar system. Check out the video [Phases of Venus](https://youtu.be/7FBpAkHEhBY?si=BsmShNiQaZWa28aN) to walk through a simulation of how this works. You can also play with the simulations for yourself: [Ptolemaic Phases of Venus](https://storage.googleapis.com/avh-sims/astroUNL/classaction/animations/renaissance/ptolemaic.html), [Heliocentric Phases of Venus](https://storage.googleapis.com/avh-sims/astroUNL/classaction/animations/renaissance/venusphases.html).
