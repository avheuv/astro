- **How'd it go?** Well, here we are at the end of our class. I want to hear what you thought of it. Could you please take a minute to complete [this anonymous student feedback form](https://forms.gle/NWp6EZwzVEkLCvGx8)? Your feedback is really important to me, and it will help me continue to improve the course in the future.
- The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (or SETI) is both a specific organization and a broader movement. While considered "fringe" at its origin, it has increasingly become a part of the mainstream astronomy research community. Watch the video [An Introduction to SETI](https://youtu.be/W9vos95ernk?t=13).
- Explore the [SETI Website](https://www.seti.org/) to read about their latest [news](https://www.seti.org/news), the affiliated [scientists](https://www.seti.org/our-scientists), or the [history of the institute](https://www.seti.org/origin-of-the-institute). 
- Read [30.4 The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/30-4-the-search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligence) to learn about the efforts astronomers are making in the search for extraterrestrial intelligent life and the challenges they face.
- The birth of SETI is closely tied to the formulation of the Drake Equation. Watch the video [The Drake Equation](https://youtu.be/A7yuFAr18ag) and then experiment with [this interactive version of the Drake Equation](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/the-drake-equation/) to arrive at your own estimate for the number of alien civilizations in our universe.
- If there are advanced alien civilizations all over the universe, then it is reasonable to ask "Where are they?" This question has come to be known as the Fermi Paradox. Watch the [Fermi Paradox video](https://youtu.be/hcsrwE8afQQ?t=13) for several potential solutions to the paradox.
- Searching for life in the universe may be a terrible idea. Watch the Kurzgesagt video [Why We Should NOT Look For Aliens](https://youtu.be/xAUJYP8tnRE?si=m4N3_8g7TFXmr7Rp).
