title: Solar Flare Story Discussion
---

In this discussion, we'll reflect on a frightening, but real possibility - that a massive solar flare strikes the Earth, resulting in the sudden catastrophic failure of all electrical systems, the internet, satellites, and other technologies. Let's imagine that the damage from this event is expected to last 6-12 months.

- **Write Your Reflection:** Imagine how such an event would personally impact your life. What challenges would you face? How would you adapt to this new reality? Write a brief reflection (at least 150 words) describing how your daily routines, relationships, and outlook on life might change in the aftermath of this event. Be specific and thoughtful.
- **Engage with Classmates:** Read through some of your classmates' reflections. Choose at least one reflection to respond to. In your reply, share your thoughts on their perspective — what similarities or differences do you see to your own reflection? Offer encouragement, additional ideas, or questions to further the discussion.

I’m excited to see how each of you envisions adapting to a world without modern technology. Let's reflect, share, and learn from one another's perspectives!
