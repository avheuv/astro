title: Darkest Sky Discussion
---

In this discussion, we're going to work collaboratively to write a brief piece of astronomy-inspired science fiction. Each of you will post an opening line for your own story. You will then reply to one another's posts, contributing the next line in their ever unfolding story. 

Here's the premise: A massive solar flare has just struck Earth, leading to a catastrophic failure of all electrical systems, the internet, satellites, and more. The severity of the damage means we're facing 6-12 months without these technologies. 

- Start a Story: On the discussion board, post the opening line of a story set in this world plunged into a technological blackout. Your line should set the stage for a narrative that unfolds in this new reality.
- Continue the Story: Browse your classmates' posts. Choose five different story starters and contribute the next line by replying to their posts. Follow the narrative thread established by those who have already replied, adding further to the story.
- Be a Team Player: Embrace a "Yes, andâ€¦" approach by building upon the ideas of your classmates. You should aim to add to the narrative thoughtfully, without diverting it into an entirely different direction.

I'm curious how many different and unique stories we'll see emerge in this discussion.
