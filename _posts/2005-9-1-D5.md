title: Astronomy in the Visual Arts Discussion
---

Astronomy has long been a muse for the creative world, influencing not just classical paintings but also modern visual arts, including album covers, TV shows, books, and movies. This week, your task is to share an example of how the cosmos has inspired visual art.

- Discover and Select: Seek out a piece of visual art that has been inspired by astronomy. This could include traditional paintings, digital creations, film and TV visuals, music album art, or book illustrations.
- Share Your Findings: Upload an image of the art piece directly to the discussion board. (Let's keep our examples PG.)
- Describe the Astronomical Influence: Along with your image, include a brief description of the specific astronomical phenomenon or concept depicted in the artwork. Discuss how the artist has interpreted or represented this particular aspect of astronomy.

Please post your art selections and descriptions on the discussion board. Additionally, engage with your classmates by commenting on at least one other post, discussing the diverse ways in which astronomy continues to inspire the visual arts.
