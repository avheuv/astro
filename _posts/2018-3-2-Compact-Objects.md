- Read [23.4 Pulsars and the Discovery of Neutron Stars](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/23-4-pulsars-and-the-discovery-of-neutron-stars) to understand how the discovery of mysterious "pulsars" provided the first observational evidence that neutron stars really exist.
- Watch the BBC clip [What are Pulsars?](https://storage.googleapis.com/avh-astro-videos/What%20are%20pulsars_.webm) to hear from Jocelyn Bell as she recounts her discovery of pulsars.
- When the most massive stars collapse, not even neutrons can hold up against the weight of gravitational collapse. The result is an object with so much gravity that not even light can escape. Explore [24.5 Black Holes](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/24-5-black-holes) to learn about the formation and characteristics of black holes, including the concept of event horizons and singularities.
- Black holes can be created when just a single large star collapses after its supernova explosion, but astronomers have also seen evidence for so-called "supermassive black holes." These are enormous monsters with the gravity of over 3 million stars compressed into an infinitely tiny space. Watch the video [Monster of the Milky Way](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CbI0NjgyMxRmLkxylyIgd0s1VScKX1jx), which shows how astronomers can prove that our own galaxy has a supermassive black hole, even though no one can see it directly. (Be sure to watch to the end of the video for the amazing proof that black holes exist.)
- In 2019, a team of astronomers from around the world released the first picture ever showing a black hole. Strictly speaking, the image doesnâ€™t show the black hole itself, but rather the light from the hot accretion disk around the black hole. Watch the news summary [First Image of a Black Hole](https://youtu.be/UlNYgSP9qNU) to learn about the discovery. This seems to be further irrefutable evidence that black holes are real.
