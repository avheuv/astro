title: Sky Cultures Discussion
---

Each culture around the world has built a mythology around the sky. Let's explore how various people have constructed constellations out of the same groups of stars. We will use the incredible [Figures in the Sky](https://avheuv.github.io/skyculture/) interactive website. The website will probably work best on computers (rather than mobile devices) and it may be a little confusing at first, so check out my brief [Introduction to Figures in the Sky](https://youtu.be/Z9MaQU5uXOA) video.

- Navigate the Website: Begin by familiarizing yourself with the website's features. Explore its interactive sky maps, focusing on the section "The same sky, different figures" which highlights how individual stars have been used by different cultures to create different constellations.
- Select and Share a Non-Western Constellation: Identify a constellation from a non-Western culture that resonates with you or piques your curiosity. Take a screenshot of this constellation as depicted on the website.
- Reflect on Your Exploration: After your exploration, contribute to our discussion board with a post that includes your screenshot and completes the following reflection prompts:
  - *"This was cool because..."* Share what you found interesting, surprising, or particularly engaging about the constellation you chose and the website's presentation of different astronomical cultures.
  - *"This makes me wonder..."* Reflect on any new questions or thoughts this exploration sparked. For example, consider how this diversity in celestial interpretation affects our understanding of the universe or what it reveals about the intersection between astronomy and culture.
