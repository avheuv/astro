title: Inside a Black Hole Discussion
---

In this discussion, we'll combine astronomy and the latest generative AI technology to create visualizations of the most enigmatic cosmic phenomenon: the inside of a black hole. The appearance of the interior of a black hole is purely theoretical and impossible to observe directly, so we will have some fun using AI to help us create an artistic representation of what this strange world may possibly look like.

- Craft Your AI Prompt: Based on your knowledge from the course and any additional research you find necessary, write a detailed prompt for a generative AI image creator. Your prompt should reflect the scientific concepts we learn about in this unit, but it should also specify the artisic style, tone, palette, etc. of the image you would like created.
- Generate Your Image: Use a free AI image generators to bring your prompt to life: [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/), [CoPilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/), [Dall-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2), or just search the web for a "free ai image generator." 
- Share and Explain: Post both the prompt you authored and the image generated by the AI tool on our discussion board. Exlain why you took this particular approach for your visualization. 

After sharing your AI-generated vision of the inside of a black hole, take some time to explore the creations of your classmates. Discuss the similarities and differences in your images of black holes. What does this exercise reveal about the challenges of representing such extreme objects?

**Tips for AI Image Prompts:** In addition to including information about the subject of the image, but also the style of image (photorealistic, oil-based painting, pencil drawing)
