title: Inside a Black Hole Discussion
---

In this discussion, we'll combine astronomy and the latest generative AI technology to create visualizations of the most enigmatic cosmic phenomenon: the inside of a black hole. The appearance of the interior of a black hole is purely theoretical and impossible to observe directly, so we will have some fun using AI to help us create an artistic representation of what this strange world may possibly look like.

- **Craft Your AI Prompt:** Based on your knowledge from the course and any additional research you find necessary, write a detailed prompt for a generative AI image creator. Your prompt should reflect a scientific understanding of black holes, and it should also specify the artistic style, tone, palette, etc. of the image you would like created. To make the image more unique, you might prompt the AI to show a particular object (a house, car, giraffee, etc.) falling into the black hole. 
- **Generate Your Image:** Use a free AI image generator to bring your prompt to life. I would recommend [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/), [CoPilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/), or [Dall-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2), but you can also just search the web for any "free ai image generator." 
- **Share and Explain:** Post both the prompt you authored and the image generated by the AI tool on our discussion board. Exlain why you took this particular approach for your visualization. 

Take some time to explore the creations of your classmates. Discuss the similarities and differences in your images of black holes. If you find ones you like, let your classmates know by acknowledging their creativity.
