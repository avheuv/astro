---

A newly discovered asteroid, named 2024 ZE, has been detected by astronomers at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. This asteroid is on a collision course with Earth, with an expected impact near the central United States in 48 hours. Scientists predict the impact will result in catastrophic damage, likely eradicating all life on Earth.

- Craft an Emergency Alert Message: You're responsible for drafting the emergency alert message that will be sent to all mobile phones in the United States. This message must be 160 characters or less and should inform the public of the impending asteroid impact. Your message needs to be clear, concise, and convey the gravity of the situation.
- Advise on Television Programming: Provide guidance to television stations on what programming they should broadcast in the final hours before the impact. Consider what content would be most appropriate or beneficial during this critical time. This should be sent in the form of a memo that is 100 words that provides guidance and justification for this choice. 
- Publish Your Work: Post your Alert Message and Programming Memo to the discussion board.  

Engage with your classmates by providing constructive feedback on their emergency alert messages and television programming memos. Discuss the effectiveness of the communication strategies employed, the choices of content for the final broadcasts, and how well you think these approaches would serve the public in such a critical time. Consider the balance between maintaining calm, providing essential information, and offering comfort.
