title: Shape of the Milky Way

- Have you ever seen the Milky Way in the night sky? Watch the teacher video [Appearance of the Milky Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WOw31XqNNo) to see what it looks like in Stellarium. 
- Explore [25.1 The Architecture of the Galaxy](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/25-1-the-architecture-of-the-galaxy) to understand the components and structure of the Milky Way Galaxy, including its disk, halo, bulge, and central black hole.
- Astronomers estimate that the Milky Way galaxy contains some 300 billion stars. It’s difficult to understand how much that really is. Check out the video [300 Billion Things](https://youtu.be/XiSq46H-xcM), which is my attempt to show you just how big of a number “300 billion” really is. In addition, you should check out this webpage, which shows one billion dots. (Keep in mind that our galaxy has 300 times as many stars as dots on this page! It may take a minute to load and be sure to scroll all the way down and to the right). Imagine that every one of those dots is a star like our sun - and each could have its own solar system of planets!
- Read [25.2 Spiral Structure](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/25-2-spiral-structure) to learn about the spiral arms and differential rotation of the Milky Way Galaxy, as well as the formation and development of spiral structure in galaxies.
