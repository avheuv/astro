title: Expanding Universe
---

- The great astronomer, Edwin Hubble, revolutionized our understanding of the universe not once, but twice. First, he discovered that galaxies are not just clouds within the Milky Way, but that they are whole galaxies unto themselves. And then, as an encore, he went on to discover that all of these galaxies are moving rapidly away from one another. This suggested to Hubble that our entire universe is expanding. Watch the NOVA clip [Hubble’s Expanding Universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppT80iy-FV0) for a summary of Hubble’s discoveries.
- Read [26.5 The Expanding Universe](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/26-5-the-expanding-universe) to discover the evidence for the expanding universe, including the redshift of distant galaxies, Hubble's law, and the concept of the Hubble constant.
