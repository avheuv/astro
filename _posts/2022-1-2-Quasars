- Read [28.1 Observations of Distant Galaxies](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/28-1-observations-of-distant-galaxies) to learn about how the color of galaxies indicates the age of their stars and the characteristics of galaxies observed in the early universe.
- Explore [28.2 Galaxy Mergers and Active Galactic Nuclei](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/28-2-galaxy-mergers-and-active-galactic-nuclei) to understand the role of galaxy collisions, mergers, and active galactic nuclei in the evolution of galaxies.
- Review [28.3 The Distribution of Galaxies in Space](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/28-3-the-distribution-of-galaxies-in-space) for an explanation of the cosmological principle, the structure of galaxy clusters and superclusters, and the distribution of galaxies in the universe.
