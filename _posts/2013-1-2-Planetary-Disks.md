title: Planetary Disks

- Extrasolar planets are of particular interest to me, personally - this was my area of research in graduate school. In fact, I was fortunate to be part of a team that actually discovered a new planet orbiting a distant star! Watch this video describing [My Story of Discovering an Exoplanet](https://youtu.be/0eGfwNndkkg).
- Read my brief article [The Day I Discovered...](https://storage.googleapis.com/avh-lessons/TheDayIDiscovered.pdf) for an honest reflection on my experience making these discoveries.  
- We've previously learned about the formation of solar systems and protoplanetary disks. Read [21.3 Evidence That Planets Form around Other Stars](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/21-3-evidence-that-planets-form-around-other-stars) to review the observational evidence we've encountered so far in the class.
