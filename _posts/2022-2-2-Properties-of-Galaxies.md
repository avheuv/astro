- Dive into [26.3 Properties of Galaxies](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/26-3-properties-of-galaxies) to explore how the masses of spiral and elliptical galaxies are determined, their mass-to-light ratios, and the presence of dark matter within galaxies.
- Explore [26.4 The Extragalactic Distance Scale](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/26-4-the-extragalactic-distance-scale) to understand how astronomers measure distances to galaxies using various methods, including cepheid variables, type Ia supernovae, and the Tully-Fisher relation.
