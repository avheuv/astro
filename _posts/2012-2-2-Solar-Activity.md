- Explore [15.2 The Solar Cycle](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/15-2-the-solar-cycle) to learn about sunspots, the solar rotation, the 11-year sunspot cycle, and the magnetic activity cycle of the Sun.
- Watch the NOVA clip [The Dynamic Sun](https://youtu.be/AIlSk14icZ8), which again shows incredible imagery from the space telescopes, illustrating the changing surface of the sun. 
- Read [15.3 Solar Activity above the Photosphere](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/15-3-solar-activity-above-the-photosphere) to understand prominences, plages, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections, and how they relate to solar activity.
- You can view real-time imagery of the sun from space telescopes using the incredible [HelioViewer Website](https://student.helioviewer.org). Check out my [HelioViewer Tutorial video](https://youtu.be/P3-69e64tn8) to learn about the features of the website.
- Review [15.4 Space Weather](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/15-4-space-weather) to grasp the effects of solar activity on Earth, including auroras, disruptions in communications, satellite damage, and power outages caused by solar flares and coronal mass ejections.
- Watch the NOVA clip [Solar Wind and Storms](https://youtu.be/Vd51i1X-Bjk) to see examples of the solar storms that can impact the earth.
