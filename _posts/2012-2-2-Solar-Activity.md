- Explore [15.2 The Solar Cycle](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/15-2-the-solar-cycle) to learn about sunspots, the solar rotation, the 11-year sunspot cycle, and the magnetic activity cycle of the Sun.
- Watch the NOVA clip [The Dynamic Sun](https://youtu.be/AIlSk14icZ8), which again shows incredible imagery from the space telescopes, illustrating the changing surface of the sun. 
- Read [15.3 Solar Activity above the Photosphere](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/15-3-solar-activity-above-the-photosphere) to understand prominences, plages, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections, and how they relate to solar activity.
- You can view real-time imagery of the sun from space telescopes using the incredible [HelioViewer Website](https://student.helioviewer.org). Check out my [HelioViewer Tutorial video](https://youtu.be/P3-69e64tn8) to learn about the features of the website.
- Review [15.4 Space Weather](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/15-4-space-weather) to grasp the effects of solar activity on Earth, including auroras, disruptions in communications, satellite damage, and power outages caused by solar flares and coronal mass ejections.
- Watch the NOVA clip [Solar Wind and Storms](https://youtu.be/Vd51i1X-Bjk) to see examples of solar storms that can impact the earth.
- Earth's ongoing geological activity produces a relatively strong magnetic field around our planet. This turns out to be quite essential for protecting us from harmful solar storms. Watch the NOVA clip [Earth's Magnetic Shield](https://youtu.be/W2LMM-w4ZoI).
- Watch [The Threat to Earth](https://youtu.be/M-tOBPISGAE) to learn more about the very real risk posed by powerful solar storms.
- Despite the threats, solar storms produce the most magical of all celestial phenomena - the aurora. Perhaps you've seen [amazing timelapse videos of the northern lights](https://youtu.be/c5rWB_fS5ao?si=QjCiKRP4ODfmRPml) before, but even more amazing is to see just how much the aurora [dance across the sky in real-time](https://youtu.be/N-TV_6eIDxw?si=7bCAP7VG6qG6PzPe). <- You MUST check out that video! Note that the video is not sped up - the aurora really changes that quickly! Imagine aurora that are so bright that they can be seen in the daytime. Absolutely incredible!
- I've seen the northern lights 4 times in my life and captured them on camera 3 times. Check out this video showing [My Best Photos of Aurora](https://youtu.be/aRNv9VxMzAg).
