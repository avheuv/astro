title: Expansion of the Universe
---

- We've seen how we can measure the distance to galaxies, and how we can measure the speed of the galaxy. These measurements suggest that our universe is expanding. But more than that, we can use these measurements to determine the age of the entire universe. Watch the teacher video [Measuring the Age of the Universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRq7GSJdLHk) for an explanation of how Hubbleâ€™s Law can accurately tell us how old the universe really is. 
- Explore [29.1 The Age of the Universe](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/29-1-the-age-of-the-universe) to understand how modern cosmological theories use observations of the universe's expansion to estimate its age, including the role of dark energy in accelerating the expansion.
- Read [29.2 A Model of the Universe](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/29-2-a-model-of-the-universe) to explore the isotropic and homogeneous models of the universe, its expansion, and the influence of dark energy on the fate of the universe.
