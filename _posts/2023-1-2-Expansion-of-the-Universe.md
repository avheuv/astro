title: Expansion of the Universe
---

- We've seen how we can measure the distance to galaxies, and how we can measure the speed of the galaxy. These measurements suggest that our universe is expanding. But more than that, we can use these measurements to determine the age of the entire universe. Watch the teacher video [Measuring the Age of the Universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRq7GSJdLHk) for an explanation of how Hubble’s Law can accurately tell us how old the universe really is. 
- Explore [29.1 The Age of the Universe](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/29-1-the-age-of-the-universe) to understand how modern cosmological theories use observations of the universe's expansion to estimate its age, including the role of dark energy in accelerating the expansion.
- The structure of the universe as a whole is largely determined by three “cosmological parameters” that astronomers use to describe the universe. These parameters are really just numbers - a constant value that describes some aspect of the universe. We will examine each of the three parameters individually.
- **H~o~: Hubble's Constant: The first cosmological parameter is Hubble’s Constant H~o~ (the slope of the line in Hubble's Law). We have already seen how Hubble's Law is related to the age of the universe, but watch the teacher video [Hubble’s Constant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sl0ivSj4EWk) to see how it also relates to the future expansion of the universe.
- Read [29.2 A Model of the Universe](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/29-2-a-model-of-the-universe) to explore the isotropic and homogeneous models of the universe, its expansion, and the influence of dark energy on the fate of the universe.
