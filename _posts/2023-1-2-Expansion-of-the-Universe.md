- Explore [29.1 The Age of the Universe](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/29-1-the-age-of-the-universe) to understand how modern cosmological theories use observations of the universe's expansion to estimate its age, including the role of dark energy in accelerating the expansion.
- Read [29.2 A Model of the Universe](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/29-2-a-model-of-the-universe) to explore the isotropic and homogeneous models of the universe, its expansion, and the influence of dark energy on the fate of the universe.
