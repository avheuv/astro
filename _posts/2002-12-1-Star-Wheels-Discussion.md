title: Star Wheels Discussion
---

Let's be honest. One of the main reasons we want to study astronomy is so that we can impress our friends or woo a mate by pointing out constellations in the night sky. Well, here's your chance. 

For this discussion board post, I would like you to teach someone else how to use a star wheel. This could be a friend, a family member, your future soulmate - whatever. Go outside at night when it is clear, and show them how the star wheel works, pointing out a couple of bright stars and constellations. Take a picture of yourself with this other person and the star wheel - you will be submitting this photo to our discussion board. 

You can create your star wheel [with paper and a printer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f7n2WbDqzkupEzLM81wDrNdBxdu6PxR5h_FtLyscIaA/edit?usp=sharing), or you can simply use [this digital star wheel](https://storage.googleapis.com/avh-agli/agli/starwheel/index.html). If necessary, you can [re-watch this teacher video](https://youtu.be/T3meP_c5Izw?si=3MXACxSKS9Ge8f8O) for instructions on assembling and using your star wheel.

In our course discussion board, post your star wheel selfie along with a brief description of what you were able to see in the sky together. Have fun!
