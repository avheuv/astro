- Read [3.4 Orbits in the Solar System](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/3-4-orbits-in-the-solar-system) to understand the paths celestial bodies take around the Sun.
- It is more or less "natural" that the larger objects in our solar system would have more circular orbits while the smaller objects would have more elliptical orbits. To see how this arises, watch [Simulating Orbits in a Solar System](https://youtu.be/vFX2cz854DU) which uses the "Create Solar Nebula" option in our [Gravity Simulator](https://www.andrewvh.com/kepler).
- Explore [3.5 Motions of Satellites and Spacecraft](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/3-5-motions-of-satellites-and-spacecraft) for insights into how artificial satellites orbit Earth and the dynamics of interplanetary travel.
- The connection between "orbit" and "free-fall" is really kind of strange. For an illustrated explanation, check out the TED-Ed video [Free falling in outer space](https://youtu.be/tAUXIEr-VzM?si=tyhksN51yMI-oAOz).
- The number of satellites that are currently in orbit above the earth is truly mind melting. Check out this [Low Earth Orbit Visualization](https://platform.leolabs.space/visualization) to see a real-time view of the satellites in orbit. (Yes, this is real.) How are those satellites not hitting each other? Well, you've got to remember that the earth is really, really big, and satellites are generally pretty small (much smaller than they look on the visualization.  
- Learn about [3.6 Gravity with More Than Two Bodies](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/3-6-gravity-with-more-than-two-bodies) and the complexities of gravitational interactions in systems with multiple celestial bodies.
