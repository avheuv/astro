- Read [3.4 Orbits in the Solar System](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/3-4-orbits-in-the-solar-system) to understand the paths celestial bodies take around the Sun.
- It is more or less "natural" that the larger objects in our solar system would have more circular orbits while the smaller objects would have more elliptical orbits. To see how this arises, watch [Simulating Orbits in a Solar System](https://youtu.be/vFX2cz854DU) which uses the "Create Solar Nebula" option in our [Gravity Simulator](https://www.andrewvh.com/kepler).
- Explore [3.5 Motions of Satellites and Spacecraft](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/3-5-motions-of-satellites-and-spacecraft) for insights into how artificial satellites orbit Earth and the dynamics of interplanetary travel.
- Learn about [3.6 Gravity with More Than Two Bodies](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/3-6-gravity-with-more-than-two-bodies) and the complexities of gravitational interactions in systems with multiple celestial bodies.
