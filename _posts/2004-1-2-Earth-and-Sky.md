- Recall that we previously learned about the Horizon Coordinate System (altitude and azimuth), which provides a simple way for us to describe the location of an object in the sky. If you'd like to review, you can re-watch the [Horizon Coordinate System video](https://youtu.be/qV8gQ-QenvI?si=DmJOPNy8Pi7Mt3NM) from a prior lesson. (You can also play with the simulations from the video: [Lat/Long Explorer](https://storage.googleapis.com/avh-sims/astroUNL/classaction/animations/coordsmotion/longlat.html) and [Alt/Az Demo](https://storage.googleapis.com/avh-sims/astroUNL/classaction/animations/coordsmotion/altazimuth.html).) 
- Explore [4.1 Earth and Sky](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/4-1-earth-and-sky) to learn how terrestrial and celestial coordinate systems, including latitude, longitude, right ascension, and declination, enable us to pinpoint locations on Earth and in the sky.
