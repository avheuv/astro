---

- Read [20.4 Cosmic Rays](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/20-4-cosmic-rays) to learn about the nature and origins of cosmic rays, which are high-energy particles traveling through interstellar space.
- - Watch the TED-Ed video [How cosmic rays help us understand the universe](https://youtu.be/91801Y1lsCg?si=ws0MM5neEiqcU2xR) for a concise introduction to cosmic rays. 
- Explore [20.5 The Life Cycle of Cosmic Material](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/20-5-the-life-cycle-of-cosmic-material) to understand how interstellar matter flows through the Galaxy, changes phases, and contributes to the formation of new stars and planetary systems.
- Watch the video [Are We Actually In A Nebula?](https://youtu.be/9BV8X76iLF8?si=IQgv-yCQpJzcUDki), which provides a nice summary of what we have learned so far in this unit as well as some very nice visuals. 
- Review [20.6 Interstellar Matter around the Sun](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/20-6-interstellar-matter-around-the-sun) to learn about the Sun's location within the Local Fluff and the Local Bubble, and how these regions affect interstellar material density around the Sun.
