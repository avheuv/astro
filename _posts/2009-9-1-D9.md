title: Golden Record Discussion

The Voyager Golden Record, sent into space in 1977, carried a selection of Earth's sounds and music, intended to represent our planet to any extraterrestrial discoverers. You can explore the contents of the original record at [GoldenRecord.org](https://goldenrecord.org/). Imagine we're compiling a new Golden Record for a future space mission. This time, we're including a song that you choose.

- **Select a Song:** Choose a song you believe should be on this new Golden Record. Consider a track that doesn't just speak to you personally but also represents your culture, community, or humanity as a whole.
- **Provide a Link:** Post a link to the song (ideally on YouTube), ensuring it is accessible to your classmates for listening.
- **Explain Your Choice:** Accompany the link with an explanation of why you chose this song. Discuss the songâ€™s significance beyond personal preference, focusing on how it represents human culture, values, or history.

After posting your selection, explore the choices made by your peers. Engage in thoughtful discussion about the different songs chosen, reflecting on what these selections reveal about the multifaceted nature of human experience and culture.
