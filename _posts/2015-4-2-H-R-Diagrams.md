title: H-R Diagrams
---

- Astronomers track stellar evolution using a tool called the HR diagram. Some would even call this tool “the most important graph in all of astronomy.” Watch the video [HR Diagrams - Part 1](https://youtu.be/1Sp1S8M801I), which introduces the basic structure of the HR diagram. 
- Review [18.4 The H–R Diagram](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/18-4-the-h-r-diagram) to understand the significance of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram in plotting stellar luminosity against surface temperature, and how it helps classify stars based on their evolutionary stage.
- This is THE lesson on H-R Diagrams... the only intro to HR that everyone will see.
