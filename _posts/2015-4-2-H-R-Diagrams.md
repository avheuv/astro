title: H-R Diagrams

- Astronomers track stellar evolution using a tool called the HR diagram. Some would even call this tool “the most important graph in all of astronomy.” Watch the video [HR Diagrams - Part 1](https://youtu.be/1Sp1S8M801I), which introduces the basic structure of the HR diagram. 
- We've already seen how measuring the luminosity and temperature of a star can tell us about its mass and radius. Let's see how that plays out on the HR Diagram. Watch the video [HR Diagrams - Part 2](https://youtu.be/bm6HhmdHvrw?si=GeXEnyyVymvntfEq).
- Now watch [HR Diagrams - Part 3](https://youtu.be/qpt5XeMSrtY?si=eIfzslrRld93rEKL) to see how plotting stars on an HR Diagram helps us categorize stars. 
- Read [18.4 The H–R Diagram](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/18-4-the-h-r-diagram) to review the significance of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram in plotting stellar luminosity against surface temperature, and how it helps classify stars based on their evolutionary stage.
