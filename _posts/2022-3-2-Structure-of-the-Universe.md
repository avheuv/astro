title: Structure of the Universe
---
 
- We learned about dark matter in a previous chapter, but the search for dark matter in the universe is a truly amazing scientific endeavor. Scientists are not only looking to detect dark matter through telescopes, but also through experiments buried deep benearth the surface of the earth. Watch [The Absurd Search for Dark Matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6etTERFUlUI) from one of my favorite YouTubers, Veritasium. 
- Read [28.4 The Challenge of Dark Matter](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/28-4-the-challenge-of-dark-matter) to understand the evidence for the existence of dark matter in galaxies and galaxy clusters, and the search for its nature, including the possibility of new types of particles.
- Read [28.5 The Formation and Evolution of Galaxies and Structure in the Universe](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/28-5-the-formation-and-evolution-of-galaxies-and-structure-in-the-universe) to explore theories on the formation of galaxies and larger structures in the universe.
- Astronomers use supercomputers to simulate the formation of our universe and the development of structure among the galaxies. Browse this video from the [Mira Supercomputer](https://youtu.be/JAyrpJCC_dw?si=26GzYJxNDG6-3tvk) (there is no sound in the video) to see how complex and enormous these simulations are. It's amazing that understanding the universe requires collaborations between astronomers, physicists, computer scientists, and engineers.
