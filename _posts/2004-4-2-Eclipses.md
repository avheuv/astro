- Solar eclipses are so incredibly awesome, but they are only possible because of a crazy coincidence. Watch the video [Angular Size of the Sun and Moon](https://youtu.be/qWwm8tvDjhE?si=kRzUQSA4rI4_DhP5) to see what I mean.
- Read [4.7 Eclipses of the Sun and Moon](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/4-7-eclipses-of-the-sun-and-moon) to understand the phenomena of solar and lunar eclipses, including their causes, occurrences, and visibility from Earth.
- Watch the teacher video [Eclipses](https://youtu.be/v9yVstcAaTw?si=6rOyh-McJPhkBDEB) to see simulations, images, and videos of both lunar and solar eclipses in action.
- Check out this amazing 5-second time-lapse video [Moon Shadow versus Sun Reflection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vp2jUQ4rNM) from a geostationary satellite looking back at the earth. It shows the shadow of the moon as it passes over the surface of the earth during a total solar eclipse.
