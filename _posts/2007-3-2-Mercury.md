- Watch the video [Rotation of Mercury](https://youtu.be/QCF0ZX4a6os) to see why the days on Mercury are especially hot.
- The unusual roation of Mercury, when coupled with its elliptical orbit, causes the sun's motion in the sky to be very strange. Check out the video [Solar Motion from Mercury.](https://youtu.be/QzRcFopsuy8)
- Read [9.5 Mercury](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/9-5-mercury) to discover more about the closest planet to the Sun, its heavily cratered surface, lack of atmosphere, and unique features like its large metal core and long scarps.
