- Watch the video [Rotation of Mercury](https://youtu.be/QCF0ZX4a6os) to see why the days on Mercury are especially hot.
- The unusual rotation of Mercury, when coupled with its elliptical orbit, causes the sun's motion in the sky to be very strange. Check out the video [Solar Motion from Mercury](https://youtu.be/QzRcFopsuy8). If you like, you can play with the [Day on Mercury Simulator](https://sciencesims.com/sims/mercury-orbit/) for yourself. 
- Read [9.5 Mercury](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/9-5-mercury) to discover more about the closest planet to the Sun, its heavily cratered surface, lack of atmosphere, and unique features like its large metal core and long scarps.
- "Messenger" was the first spacecraft to orbit Mercury. It was launched in 2004, reached orbit in 2011, and concluded its mission by crashing into Mercury in 2015. Watch [this brief video summary](https://youtu.be/Z0mxVcBum8M?si=69eYq2-BG3bulf0y) of the mission, its challenges, and achievements. 
- You would think that it would be easy to send a spacecraft to Mercury, but it's actually pretty hard to get there. Check out this video explaining [The Challenge of Reaching Mercury.](https://youtu.be/cwV8CrNof-A)
- One of the most distinctive features on the surface of Mercury is the presence of scarps. Watch this video comparing [Scarps on Earth and Mercury.](https://youtu.be/fmBB5XmFeTA)
