- Watch the video [Rotation of Mercury](https://youtu.be/QCF0ZX4a6os) to see why the days on Mercury are especially hot.
- The unusual roation of Mercury, when coupled with its elliptical orbit, causes the sun's motion in the sky to be very strange. Check out the video [Solar Motion from Mercury.](https://youtu.be/QzRcFopsuy8)
- Read [9.5 Mercury](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/9-5-mercury) to discover more about the closest planet to the Sun, its heavily cratered surface, lack of atmosphere, and unique features like its large metal core and long scarps.
- You would think that it would be easy to send a spacraft to Mercury, but it's actually pretty hard to get there. Check out this video explaining [The Challenge of Reaching Mercury.](https://youtu.be/cwV8CrNof-A)
- One of the most distinctive features on the surface of Mercury is the presence of scarps. Watch this video comparing [Scarps on Earth and Mercury.]
