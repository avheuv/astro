- Our ultimate goal in this unit is to understand how stars are born, change over time, and ultimately die. This is really hard to figure out because stars "live" for billions of years. The only way for us to answer these kinds of questions is survey millions of stars and observe them at various stages of their "lifecycles" - some newly born, others squarely in "mid-life" and others that have recently "died." 
- Explore [18.1 A Stellar Census](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/18-1-a-stellar-census) to learn about the distribution of stars in terms of brightness, luminosity, and mass, including the prevalence of low-mass stars and the discovery of brown dwarfs.
- The two key variables we will measure to understand stars are their luminosity and color. As I stated in a previous lesson, we can se these two values to determine other stellar properties (such as a star's mass and radius). But how? Well, let's consider the mass of stars first. If we think back to our study of gravity and orbits, we saw that Newton's Law of Gravity combined with Kepler's Laws allows us to accurately determine the mass of any two objects that are orbiting one another. So, if we can find two stars that are orbiting each other, we can accurately measure their masses. 
- Review [18.2 Measuring Stellar Masses](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/18-2-measuring-stellar-masses) to understand how stellar masses are determined through the analysis of binary star systems and the mass-luminosity relation.
- Read [18.3 Diameters of Stars](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/18-3-diameters-of-stars) to learn about methods for measuring the diameters of stars, including the use of eclipsing binary systems and transits.
