title: Formation of the Milky Way

- Here in the northern hemisphere, we never get the chance to view the Milky Way's dwarf galaxies in our night sky. Check out this [360 Video of the entire sky](https://youtu.be/8cXURHmtf3I?si=PoXP7MY9HTuwflF-). Click and drag around the video to change your view and try to locate the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds in the southern sky. (Hint: Look down.)
- To understand the formation of the Milky Way, we need to distinguish between Population I and Population II stars. Watch the teacher video [Stellar Populations and the Formation of the Milky Way](https://youtu.be/pNLfFQjtko0) to learn more. 
- Read [25.5 Stellar Populations in the Galaxy](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/25-5-stellar-populations-in-the-galaxy) to understand the classification of stars in the Milky Way based on their age, metallicity, and location.
- Watch the brief video [Visualizing the Milky Way Galaxy](https://youtu.be/_cU5GrRy_BA) to see the distribution of Population I and II stars. If you like, you can use the [simulation](https://physics.unm.edu/classes/applets/milkyway.html) for yourself. 
- Explore [25.6 The Formation of the Galaxy](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/25-6-the-formation-of-the-galaxy) to learn about the evolutionary history of the Milky Way Galaxy, including the formation of its different components and its eventual collision with the Andromeda galaxy.
- Watch this nice summary video of [The Formation of the Milky Way](https://youtu.be/BcjmoEspoRI?si=NfCMaNFQOwg8AnDo) from Professor Dave.
