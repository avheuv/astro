- Read [25.5 Stellar Populations in the Galaxy](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/25-5-stellar-populations-in-the-galaxy) to understand the classification of stars in the Milky Way based on their age, metallicity, and location, including population I and II stars.
- Watch the brief video [Visualizing the Milky Way Galaxy](https://youtu.be/_cU5GrRy_BA) to see the distribution of Population I and II stars. If you like, you can use the [simulation](https://physics.unm.edu/Courses/Rand/applets/milkyway.html) for yourself. 
- Explore [25.6 The Formation of the Galaxy](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/25-6-the-formation-of-the-galaxy) to learn about the evolutionary history of the Milky Way Galaxy, including the formation of its different components and its eventual collision with the Andromeda galaxy.
