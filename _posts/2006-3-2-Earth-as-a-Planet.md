title: Earth as a Planet
---

- We don't often think of earth as a planet. It's hard to see the big picture when we are standing on this giant ball of dirt and water. But we have the benefit of over 80 years of space missions that have captured images of the earth from space. Check out [this NASA Gallery](https://explorer1.jpl.nasa.gov/galleries/earth-from-space/#gallery-11) as well as my brief video, [The Earth from Space](https://youtu.be/JG-FAN7_EDA), that highlights these amazing images. 
- Explore [8.1 The Global Perspective](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/8-1-the-global-perspective) to understand Earth's interior composition, structure, magnetic field generation, and the characteristics of its crust.
- Living on a giant ball is really weird. In fact, I don't think we fully comprehend just how weird it is. Watch the video [Living on a Sphere](https://youtu.be/MZRzk-i1lc8) to see a few examples of how some simple questions lead to some surprising conclusions. If you like, you can play with the [Antipodes Explorer](https://storage.googleapis.com/avh-sims/astroUNL/classaction/animations/coordsmotion/antipodesexplorer.html) and read the [Across the Ocean article](https://metrocosm.com/whats-across-the-ocean/) for yourself.
- Review [8.2 Earth’s Crust](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/8-2-earths-crust) to learn about terrestrial rock classifications, plate tectonics, and surface geological features driven by crustal movement.
- Read [8.3 Earth’s Atmosphere](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/8-3-earths-atmosphere) for insights into Earth's atmospheric composition, structure, circulation patterns, and its role in climate variations.
- Explore [8.4 Life, Chemical Evolution, and Climate Change](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/8-4-life-chemical-evolution-and-climate-change) to understand the origins of life, the impact of photosynthesis on atmospheric composition, and the role of greenhouse gases in climate change.
- Watch the MinutePhysic video, [How Do Greenhouse Gases Really Work?](https://youtu.be/sTvqIijqvTg?si=-JfvPa3tI1HYCpuR)
- Review [8.5 Cosmic Influences on the Evolution of Earth](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/8-5-cosmic-influences-on-the-evolution-of-earth) for insights into the effects of cosmic impacts on Earth's history, including mass extinctions, and current efforts to predict and understand these events.
