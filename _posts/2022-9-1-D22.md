title: Space Quotes Discussion
---

The study of astronomy can be a source of inspiration that causes us to reflect on our place in the cosmos. For this discussion, let's channel that inspiration by connecting an amazing image of space with an inspiring space-related quote. For example, [check out this image](https://storage.googleapis.com/avh-lessons/spacequote.png) to see what I mean.

- **Choose Your Quote:** Begin by selecting a quote about space from a notable scientist or author. Some of the most quotable scientists include Carl Sagan, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Stephen Hawking, Albert Einstein, and Richard Feynman.
- **Create Your Visual:** Transform your chosen quote into a compelling visual. Let your creativity flow as you design a piece that not only showcases the quote but also incorporates some amazing astronomical imagery. (Use whatever free editing tool that you're comfortable with - [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) is awesome, but you can just use Google Docs if you prefer.)
- **Share and Reflect:** Post your creation to the discussion board. Alongside your visual, include a brief explanation of why you chose this quote. What about this quote speaks to you, or how does it reflect your views on the exploration and understanding of the cosmos?

After posting your space quote, check out your classmates' posts on the discussion board. If you find ones you like, let your classmates know by acknowledging their creativity.
