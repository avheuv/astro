title: The Beginning of the Universe
---

- We understand a surprising amount about the first moments of the universe, thanks largely to the field of particular physics. Review [29.3 The Beginning of the Universe](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/29-3-the-beginning-of-the-universe) to understand the origins of the Big Bang theory and how the universe evolved from a hot, dense state to its current form.
- In the decades after Hubble, there continued to be advances in our understanding of the birth of our universe. The most important discovery was made in 1964 when two engineers accidentally found direct evidence for the cosmic microwave background (CMB).
- Explore [29.4 The Cosmic Microwave Background](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/29-4-the-cosmic-microwave-background) to learn about the discovery and significance of the cosmic microwave background radiation, including its role in revealing the composition and age of the universe.
