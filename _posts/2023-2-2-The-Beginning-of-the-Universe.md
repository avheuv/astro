title: The Beginning of the Universe
---

- The expansion of the universe, when played in reverse, points back to a time when the entire universe was compressed to a very small region of space. And so, Hubble's Law provided the first observational evidence that our universe had a beginning. Up until this time, most astronomers assumed that the universe had always existed in its current form - a so-called "steady-state" model of the universe. 
-  Read [29.3 The Beginning of the Universe](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/29-3-the-beginning-of-the-universe) to understand the origins of the Big Bang theory and how the universe evolved from a hot, dense state to its current form.
-  We understand a surprising amount about the first moments of the universe, thanks largely to the field of particular physics. In fact, as a young astronomy student, I read the famous book "[The First Three Minutes](https://archive.org/details/TheFirstThreeMinutesAModernViewOfTheOriginOfTheUniverseS.Weinberg/mode/2up)" which is 168 pages describing the evolution of the universe during the first 3 minutes after the big bang. The book includes a chapter called "The First One-Hundredth Second." (My memory of the book was that it was confusing and boring.) 
- In the decades after Hubble's discovery, there continued to be advances in our understanding of the birth of our universe. The most important discovery, by far, was made in 1964 when two engineers accidentally found direct evidence for the big bang through the discovery of the "cosmic microwave background" or CMB. The discovery of the CMB is one of the most interesting stories in modern astronomy. Watch the video [Evidence for the Big Bang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ul3prmzpTY), which explains how these two young engineers accidentally made a Nobel Prize winning discovery.
- Explore [29.4 The Cosmic Microwave Background](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/29-4-the-cosmic-microwave-background) to learn about the discovery and significance of the cosmic microwave background radiation, including its role in revealing the composition and age of the universe.
