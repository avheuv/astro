- Watch my [Introduction to Star Formation](https://youtu.be/hg_jNIoBmiE). Then take some time to explore the [Image of the Orion Nebula](https://storage.googleapis.com/avh-astro-videos/Orion_Head_to_Toe.jpg) on your own. See if you can identify examples of emission nebulae, reflection nebulae, and dark nebulae in the image.
- Read [21.1 Star Formation](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/21-1-star-formation) to learn about the process of star formation in giant molecular clouds, including the formation of protostars and the development of stellar winds and Herbig-Haro objects.
- Let's examine star formation in greater detail. Watch the video [Star Formation and the HR Diagram](https://youtu.be/nFt5gtcwM7I) to dig deeper into our theory of star formation, see how protostars are graphed on the HR Diagram, and examine real images of protostars in the middle of the formation process.
- Explore [21.2 The Hâ€“R Diagram and the Study of Stellar Evolution](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/21-2-the-h-r-diagram-and-the-study-of-stellar-evolution) to understand how changes in temperature and luminosity are used to describe stellar evolution, with a focus on the main sequence.
- While the basics of star formation may seem clear, the details are very complex. Astronomers use sophisticated computer models to simulate star formation, protostellar winds, and the internal structure of protostars. Check out this collection of [Star Formation Simulations](https://www.starforge.space/movies.html) from the STARFORGE research group. Many of the videos are VR-enabled, so you can click and drag the video for a 360-degree view. Keep in mind that these are physical simulations, not just animations.
