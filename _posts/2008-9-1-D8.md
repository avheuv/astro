title: Ethics of Mars Colonization Discussion
---

In the original Jurassic Park film a character reflects on the ethics of cloning dinosaurs by remarking “Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they **could**, they didn’t stop to think if they **should**.” As humanity pursues the exploration and colonization of Mars, we need to confront our own question of ethics, "How far should we go?"

- Should we send humans to Mars, stepping beyond unmanned probes and rovers to leave our footprint on another world?
- Should the establishment of a permanent human presence on Mars be our goal?
- Do we dare to dream bigger and pursue terraforming Mars, reshaping an entire planet to support human life?

Reflect on these questions and articulate your stance. How far do you think humanity should go in the exploration and colonization of Mars? In your response, consider the trade-offs of human vs. robotic exploration, the viability and ethics of establishing a permanent human presence, and the monumental task of terraforming an entire planet. 

Post your insights and join the debate on our course discussion board. This is an opportunity to explore the boundaries of our current capabilities, the moral implications of our choices, and the potential for future generations to call another planet home.
