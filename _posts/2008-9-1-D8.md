title: Ethics of Mars Colonization Discussion
---

In the original Jurassic Park film a character reflects on the ethics of of cloning dinosaurs by remarking “Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they **could**, they didn’t stop to think if they **should**.” As humanity pursues the exploration and colonization of Mars, we need to confront our own question of ethics, "How far should we go?"

- Should we send humans to Mars, stepping beyond unmanned probes and rovers to leave our footprint on another world?
- Is the establishment of a permanent human presence on Mars the next giant leap, setting up colonies that could one day flourish?
- Do we dare to dream bigger and contemplate terraforming Mars, reshaping an entire planet to support human life?

Reflect on these questions and articulate your stance. In your response, dive into the complexities of human vs. robotic exploration, the viability and ethics of establishing a permanent human presence, and the monumental task of terraforming. What do you think we should do, and importantly, why?

Post your insights and join the debate on our course discussion board. This is an opportunity to explore the boundaries of our current capabilities, the moral implications of our choices, and the potential for future generations to call another planet home.
