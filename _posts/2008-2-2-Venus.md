- Watch [The First Time We Saw All of Venus](https://youtu.be/kSPXrzxwtCE?si=9gff9PMwNxPSESLG) to learn about the Magellan Mission and how it transformed our understanding of the surface of Venus.
- Review [10.2 The Geology of Venus](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/10-2-the-geology-of-venus) to understand how radar mapping has revealed its crust composition, volcanic features, and complex tectonic patterns, along with the inhospitable conditions on its surface.
- Explore the surface of Venus for yourself by using [this map of Venus from Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/space/venus/). See if you can identify lava flows, impact craters, and volcanoes across the surface.
- Read [10.3 The Massive Atmosphere of Venus](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/10-3-the-massive-atmosphere-of-venus) to learn about Venus's predominantly CO2 atmosphere, thick sulfuric acid clouds, and extreme greenhouse effect responsible for its high surface temperature.
- Check out the video [Carbon Dioxide and Infrared Light](https://youtu.be/y4KoFN5Jl6U) to see how CO2 blocks infrared radiation and prevents that energy from escaping through the atmosphere of Venus.
- With the exception of its terrible atmosphere, Venus is the closest thing to earth's twin in our solar system. Is it possible for us to alter Venus to make it habitable for life as we know it. Watch the video [How to Terraform Venus](https://youtu.be/G-WO-z-QuWI?si=L6kEcGBX0hdDfhyd) from Kurzgesagt.
