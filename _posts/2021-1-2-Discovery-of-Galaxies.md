title: Discovery of Galaxies

- It took astronomers many centuries to understand the true nature of galaxies. For many years, astronomers believed that they were just clouds or nebulas within our own galaxy. In fact, astronomers believed that our Milky Way represented the entire universe - that there was nothing else beyond it. It wasn’t until astronomers were able to measure the distances to galaxies that they really understood just how unbelievably enormous our universe really is. (These measurements were first made by Hubble in the 1920’s.) 
- Explore [26.1 The Discovery of Galaxies](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/26-1-the-discovery-of-galaxies) to learn about the historical development of our understanding of galaxies, including the role of Hubble in establishing the existence of galaxies beyond the Milky Way.
- To measure the distance to galaxies, astronomers look for "standard candles" within these galaxies. A standard candle is any object that shines with a known luminosity. If astronomers know how much light the object gives off and they know how faint it appears in our night sky, then they can easily calculate how far away the galaxy is. Watch the teacher video [Standard Candles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXmbLdpXsmE) for a review of the two most useful standard candles for measuring distances to galaxies: supernovae and Cepheid variables.
- Galaxies are far more enormous than anything we have studied so far in this class. You might be surprised, though, to learn about how far apart they are spread. Watch the teacher video [Galactic Distances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H31DzXZuIb4) for an introduction to the scale of distances between galaxies.
- Read [26.2 Types of Galaxies](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/26-2-types-of-galaxies) to understand the classification of galaxies based on their shapes and compositions, including spirals, ellipticals, and irregulars, as well as the factors influencing their appearances over time.
