title: Discovery of Galaxies

- It took astronomers many centuries to understand the true nature of galaxies. For many years, astronomers believed that they were just clouds or nebulas within our own galaxy. In fact, astronomers believed that our Milky Way represented the entire universe - that there was nothing else beyond it. It wasn’t until astronomers were able to measure the distances to galaxies that they really understood just how unbelievably enormous our universe really is. (These measurements were first made by Hubble in the 1920’s.)

- Read [26.2 Types of Galaxies](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/26-2-types-of-galaxies) to understand the classification of galaxies based on their shapes and compositions, including spirals, ellipticals, and irregulars, as well as the factors influencing their appearances over time.
