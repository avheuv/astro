title: Planetary Evolution
---

- Read [14.5 Planetary Evolution](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/14-5-planetary-evolution) to understand how each planet in the solar system evolved differently from its common beginning, examining factors such as geological activity, surface features like mountains, atmospheres, and the potential for supporting life.
- The reading challenges us to think differently about geologic activity, especially for the colder moons in the outer solar system. In particular, the article says that "we see evidence of low-temperature volcanism." What does this mean? How can you have low temperature lava or volcanoes? Watch the BBC video, [Tectonic faults on Enceladus](https://youtu.be/-CM0CGEOJDM?si=e1kCONCozAEaLh5o) to see how water can act like lava driving ice volcanoes in the outer solar system.
- Venus, Earth, and Mars formed under very similar conditions, but the final result of each planet is dramatically different. While astronomical and geolocial events played a role in making earth as we know it today, I'm fascinated by the fact that life also played a significant role shaping the earth. Watch the video, [How Life Altered Earth's Atmosphere](https://youtu.be/Ff01e17PKVo).
