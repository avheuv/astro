- In a previous lesson, we learned that the sun moves relative to the stars, completing one full cycle around entire celestial sphere each year. For a reminder, you can re-watch the [Apparent Motion of the Sun](https://youtu.be/rdV39WML5gU?si=8DWZaBoaZsPU9Tnn) video.
- In addition to moving eastward relative to the stars, the Sun also moves higher and lower in the sky over the course of the year. Read [4.2 The Seasons](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/4-2-the-seasons) to understand the role of Earth's axial tilt in creating the seasonal cycle, explaining how the Sun's position affects day length and heating throughout the year.
- I'm sure you've learned about the seasons in previous science classes, but you've probably never tried to use terms like "declination" and "meridional altitude" to make sense of the sun's changing position in the sky. Watch the [Seasons and Ecliptic Simulator](https://youtu.be/oPhkyp6TLqA?si=tNhEC9Eq50zl-v3t) video to see how all of these ideas and terminology connect to one another. You can also [use the simulator yourself.](https://storage.googleapis.com/avh-sims/astroUNL/classaction/animations/coordsmotion/eclipticsimulator.html)
- Explore [4.3 Keeping Time](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/4-3-keeping-time) for insights into how solar motion affects global timekeeping.
- Learn more about the historical efforts to align day, month, and year lengths by reading [4.4 The Calendar](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/4-4-the-calendar).
