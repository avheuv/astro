---

- In this activity, you will experience firsthand how those amazing images of outer space are captured by telescopes and then turned into magnificent works of art. 
- Watch [this video tutorial](https://youtu.be/KmCEG-l_dg4), which shows you exactly what is expected for this activity.
- When you are ready to begin, open [this shared Google Slides presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-KOpQnXSXwof8JOSrwhCPcfXbiHkfioi0aOHmg5bcRI/edit?usp=sharing).
- Combine the provided images to create true color pictures of the five astronomical objects. There will be variation in the finished results from one student to the next, and that is ok.
- Select one image from your presentation that you'd like to share. [Take a screenshot](https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/) of this image. Then, upload the screenshot to the the Color the Universe Discussion. This will allow you to share your work and explore the creations of your classmates.
