title: The Death of Stars
---

- Watch the Kurzgesagt video [White Dwarfs](https://youtu.be/qsN1LglrX9s?si=kfuVyYlm8CtRLIZE) to learn what will happen to our sun when it dies.
- Read [23.1 The Death of Low-Mass Stars](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/23-1-the-death-of-low-mass-stars) to understand how low-mass stars evolve into white dwarfs and eventually black dwarfs.
- Consider what is happening inside a star when it reaches the end of its life. Gravity gradually overtakes any outward force that may be holding up the star. Depending on the initial mass of the star, it will continue to collapse, forming a so-called "compact object" - these are some of the most fascinating and unusual objects in our entire universe. Watch the teacher video [Compact Objects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F32m8k7Tihs) for a brief explanation of what is happening inside these dying stars. 
- Read [23.2 Evolution of Massive Stars: An Explosive Finish](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/23-2-evolution-of-massive-stars-an-explosive-finish) to learn about the fusion processes in massive stars and the formation of neutron stars through supernova explosions.
- Review [23.3 Supernova Observations](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/23-3-supernova-observations) to understand the frequency of supernovae in the Milky Way Galaxy, the observation of SN 1987A, and the significance of supernova explosions in the universe.
