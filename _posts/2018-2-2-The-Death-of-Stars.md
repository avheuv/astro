title: The Death of Stars
---

- Now let's consider what happens to stars as they approach the end of their lives. The final destination of a star depends entirely on its mass. Low-mass stars (like the sun) will shed their outer layers as a planetary nebulae while their cores collapses to form a white dwarf. Higher mass stars ultimately explode in a tremendous burst of energy called a supernova, leaving behing a cloud of debris and a core that has transformed into a bizarre new kind of object - either a neutron star or black hole.
- First, let's consider the death of low-mass stars. Read [22.4 Further Evolution of Stars](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/22-4-further-evolution-of-stars) to learn about the final stages of a sun-like star's life and how it can eventually become a planetary nebula.
- Watch the video [Planetary Nebula Gallery](https://youtu.be/YxAR_a0mfiQ) and explore the [gallery](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vS63wkDLMXL49VV7ZCUYL18TkqYHuT9bIYSPph1AG_V8HZSych53_-A0D8WYJmWU6Llh91Y1KQcuViW/pub?start=true&loop=false&delayms=3000) for yourself. 
- Now let's explore how the core of a low-mass star evolves into a white dwarf (and eventually a black dwarf). Read section [23.1 The Death of Low-Mass Stars](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/23-1-the-death-of-low-mass-stars).
- Watch the Kurzgesagt video [White Dwarfs](https://youtu.be/qsN1LglrX9s?si=kfuVyYlm8CtRLIZE) for a lovely illustration of the evolution of low mass stars. 
- To understand what is happening inside the final collapse of a star's core, we need to think about the actual atoms of gas within it. Watch the teacher video [Compact Objects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F32m8k7Tihs) to see how gravity eventually tears apart the atoms of a dying star. 
- Now let's examine what happens to larger stars when they die. Read [23.2 Evolution of Massive Stars: An Explosive Finish](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/23-2-evolution-of-massive-stars-an-explosive-finish) to learn about the formation of neutron stars through supernova explosions.
- Create a video on supernovas here, show the simulation, historical photos of supernovae, supernova remnants. Perhaps start with planetary nebula (low mass death) and then constrast to high mass death and supernovas. Also show pictrues of galaxies with stars going nova.
- Review [23.3 Supernova Observations](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/23-3-supernova-observations) to understand the frequency of supernovae in the Milky Way Galaxy, the observation of SN 1987A, and the significance of supernova explosions in the universe.
