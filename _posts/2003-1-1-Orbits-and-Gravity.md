- Read [3.2 Newton’s Great Synthesis](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/3-2-newtons-great-synthesis) to learn how Newton's three laws revolutionized our understanding of objects in motion.
- Explore the principles behind [3.3 Newton’s Universal Law of Gravitation](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/3-3-newtons-universal-law-of-gravitation), explaining the force that maintains planets in orbit and how it allows us to calculate the masses of celestial objects.
