- Before we think too hard about life elsewhere in the universe, it's important to remember just how crazy and diverse life is here on earth. Check out my brief video [Aliens in the Aquarium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT5Qtm3WBbw). 
- Watch the video [Life in the Universe](https://youtu.be/pKjdg_XA8YM?si=EQcZCCFZya3lRbMM) for an introduction to the scientific search for alien life. 
- Read [30.1 The Cosmic Context for Life](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/30-1-the-cosmic-context-for-life) to explore the conditions necessary for life and the implications of the Copernican principle and Fermi paradox.
- Explore [30.2 Astrobiology](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/30-2-astrobiology) to learn about the study of life in the universe, including its origin on Earth, and the conditions required for life as we know it.
- Scientist would love to understand how life began on earth - how non-living material first became living. One of the most interesting approaches I've seen to this question is illustrated in the TED Talk [The Line Between Life and Non-Life](https://youtu.be/AmaWeoN53K4). Watch the video to see fascinating demonstrations from simple experiments that attempt to create life-like objects out of very simple chemicals. It kind of reminds me of the video game Osmos... (in fairness, almost everthing reminds me of Osmos).
