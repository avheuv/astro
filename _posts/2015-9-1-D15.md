title: Light Pollution Discussion
---

The focus of our discussion is the impact of light pollution, a phenomenon that has transformed our view of the cosmos from the ground up. To inform our conversation, we will rely on a series of factsheets from [DarkSky International](https://darksky.org/): [Introduction to Light Pollution](https://storage.googleapis.com/avh-lessons/lp-lightpollution.pdf), [Impact on Humans](https://storage.googleapis.com/avh-lessons/lp-humans.pdf), [Impact on Wildlife](https://storage.googleapis.com/avh-lessons/lp-wildlife.pdf), [Safety Concerns](https://storage.googleapis.com/avh-lessons/lp-safety.pdf), [Energy Concerns](https://storage.googleapis.com/avh-lessons/lp-energy.pdf). To begin, though, let's start with a personal experience of the night sky. 

- Share Your Story: Recall and describe the experience of the darkest night sky you have ever observed. Where were you? What details do you remember about the stars, the Milky Way, or any celestial objects you could see? Reflect on how this experience made you feel and what it meant to you personally.
- Reflect on Light Pollution: After sharing your story, reflect on the various issues of light pollution. What do you think are the most important? How do you think light pollution impacts our cultural and personal connections to the night sky? Consider the implications for future generations and how the diminishing visibility of stars might affect our collective imagination, scientific curiosity, and cultural heritage.
- Contribute to the Discussion: Post your narrative and reflections on the discussion board. Your insights will form the basis for a broader conversation about the significance of preserving dark skies not just for astronomers, but for humanity as a whole.

Engage with your classmates on the discussion board. Feel free to argue, disagree, and share your own perspective. This is a real issue facing communities around the world, and people genuinely disagree on the urgency of the problem.
