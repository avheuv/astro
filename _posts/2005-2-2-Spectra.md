- Begin by watching this excellent introduction to spectra in astronomy, [Unweaving the rainbow](https://youtu.be/Qy8qlsVvVTc?si=XpXdwWAkJSLHN6Cu) from the European Space Agency. 
- Watch the video [Three Types of Spectra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjMBykTz66I), which provides a brief introduction to Kirchoffâ€™s Laws of Radiation. 
- Review [5.3 Spectroscopy in Astronomy](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/5-3-spectroscopy-in-astronomy) to understand how spectrometers reveal the composition of astronomical objects through the analysis of their spectra.
- Watch the teacher video [Color and Chemical Elements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcwvbwV_TWQ) for a visual explanation of the connection between spectra and chemical elements. If you are interested, you can experiment with the [Hydrogen Atom Simulator](https://storage.googleapis.com/avh-sims/astroUNL/naap/hydrogen/animations/hydrogen_atom.html) for yourself. 
- Read [5.4 The Structure of the Atom](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/5-4-the-structure-of-the-atom) to explore the composition and structure of atoms, and then explore [5.5 Formation of Spectral Lines](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/5-5-formation-of-spectral-lines) to discover how spectral lines are formed through emission and absorption processes, revealing the composition of astronomical sources.
- Spectra are used in SO many parts of astronomy, that it is difficult to over-emphasize their importance. Watch the video [Spectra in Astronomy](https://youtu.be/OhbjNbvpLcI?si=_VYYVBJK-PqNq3Dq) to see how we can use spectra to answer several important questions about objects in deep space. 
- Read [5.6 The Doppler Effect](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/5-6-the-doppler-effect) to understand how the Doppler effect shifts spectral lines, allowing astronomers to measure the radial velocities of celestial objects.
