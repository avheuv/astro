- Begin by watching the video [Three Types of Spectra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjMBykTz66I), which provides a brief introduction to Kirchoffâ€™s Laws of Radiation. 
- Review [5.3 Spectroscopy in Astronomy](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/5-3-spectroscopy-in-astronomy) to understand how spectrometers reveal the composition of astronomical objects through the analysis of their spectra.
- Read [5.4 The Structure of the Atom](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/5-4-the-structure-of-the-atom) to explore the composition and structure of atoms.
- Explore [5.5 Formation of Spectral Lines](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/5-5-formation-of-spectral-lines) to discover how spectral lines are formed through emission and absorption processes, revealing the composition of astronomical sources.
- Read [5.6 The Doppler Effect](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/5-6-the-doppler-effect) to understand how the Doppler effect shifts spectral lines, allowing astronomers to measure the radial velocities of celestial objects.
