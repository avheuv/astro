title: Numbers in Astronomy
---

- Astronomy is a mathematical science. I've done my best to make the math in this course painless, interesting, and (dare I say it) fun. But understanding a few key math concepts will greatly improve your enjoyment of this class and your understanding of the universe.
- Explore [Appendix C: Scientific Notation](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/c-scientific-notation) to learn how we will use scientific notation to deal with very large or very small numbers in astronomy. Don't worry about the "excercises" at the end. I'm not asking you to complete those.
- Read [Appendix D: Units Used in Science](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/d-units-used-in-science) for an explanation of the metric units we will use to describe size, mass, and temperature of celestial objects.
- An important unit of measure in astronomy is the "light-year." Watch [this nice demonstration from NASA](https://youtu.be/MX3PIkbTQwQ?si=a03EFRrG9cNcv3Qt), which illustrates how we can use light travel time to measure large distances in space.
- Review [1.4 Numbers in Astronomy](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/1-3-numbers-in-astronomy) for a summary of all that we have learned in this lesson.
