title: Numbers in Astronomy
---

- Astronomy is a mathematical science. I've done my best to make the math in this course painless, interesting, and (dare I say it) fun. But understanding a few key math concepts will greatly improve your enjoyment of this class and your understanding of the universe.
- Explore [Appendix C: Scientific Notation](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/c-scientific-notation) to learn how we will use scientific notation to deal with very large or very small numbers in astronomy. Don't worry about the "excercises" at the end. I'm not asking you to complete those.
- Read [Appendix D: Units Used in Science] for an explanation of the metric units used in astronomy to describe size, mass, and temperature of celestial objects. 


- In astronomy - Review [Numbers in Astronomy](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/1-3-numbers-in-astronomy) to understand how astronomers handle large distances and numbers using scientific notation and the metric system. They often measure distances in light-years, the distance light travels in one year, which helps to grasp the vastness of space.
