- At this point in the class, we are shifting our perspective
- A fun, free program that you may enjoy using during this portion of our class is [Celestia](https://celestiaproject.space/). This program allows you to move through space and explore planets and other star systems up close. Watch this brief [Introduction to Celestia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIeaOieZ984) to see the basic features of the program.
- A common project in grade school science classrooms is to create a "scale model" of the solar system. These models often focus on making models of the planets that are scaled to the correct size (so that you can see just how big Jupiter is, for example), but we rarely get to see our models of the solar system scaled to the proper distances (which are enormous). One of my favorite online scale models is a simple website called [If the Moon Were Only 1 Pixel](https://storage.googleapis.com/avh-lessons/PixelSpace/joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html). 
- Explore [7.1 Overview of Our Planetary System](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/7-1-overview-of-our-planetary-system) to gain an understanding of the composition and diversity of our solar system, including the Sun, planets, dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and meteorites.
