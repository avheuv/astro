title: Eulogy for a Star Discussion
---

In this discussion, we'll be writing a eulogy for a star. Stars lead fascinating lives from their fiery births in nebulae to their often dramatic ends. This assignment invites you to consider the lifecycle of a star not just as a series of physical processes but as a journey with a beginning, middle, and an end. By composing a eulogy, you'll explore the significance of these celestial bodies in the cosmos and reflect on the universal themes of birth, life, and death.

- Select a Star: Choose a specific star or a type of star (e.g., a massive star that ends its life in a supernova, a sun-like star that transitions into a white dwarf, or a star that becomes a neutron star). Research the lifecycle of this star, from its formation to its eventual demise.
- Write the Eulogy: Compose a eulogy for your chosen star. In your writing, reflect on the stages of the star's life, its contributions to the universe (such as the elements it forged in its core and the impact of its death on surrounding space), and what it symbolizes in the broader context of cosmic evolution.
- Share and Discuss: Post your eulogy to the discussion board.

After posting your eulogy, read and respond to at least one of your classmates' submissions. Pretend that you are a visiting that star's funeral to pay your respects. Your discussion reply should be the comment you leave in the guestbook at the funeral home. What do you want to say to the family of this dearly departed star?
