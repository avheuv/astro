- Explore [14.1 Meteors](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/14-1-meteors) to learn about the formation of meteors when interplanetary dust enters Earth's atmosphere and how meteor showers are associated with comets.
- When earth passes through the debris left behind from a comet, we see a meteor shower. The website [MeteorShowers.org](https://www.meteorshowers.org/) has an awesome visualization that connects the orbit of comets, their debris fields, and the meteor showers that we can observe on earth. Watch [Comets and Meteor Showers](https://youtu.be/kToLI8uQjBI) for a brief tutorial on the website.
- I'd love to see an epic meteor storm - especially something like the 1833 Leonids with 100 meteors every second! Check out the video [Meteor Storm in Stellarium](https://youtu.be/19JX6YU-bFw) to see how we can visualize this incredible event. 
- Watch this video describing the amazing [Stardust Mission](https://youtu.be/EDqoNbmR75s?si=zUyDwfvmSOFMLugA), which captured debris from a comet (the same stuff that turns into shooting stars) and safely returned it back to earth. 
- Read [14.2 Meteorites: Stones from Heaven](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/14-2-meteorites-stones-from-heaven) to understand the classification and composition of meteorites, including primitive carbonaceous meteorites containing organic molecules.
- Check out this video where I [Visit a Meteorite Collection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86eZrZBeco0) and see real-life meteorites that come from the exact same meteor impacts that are shows in our textbook.
- You can buy a meteorite, and they're really not even that expensive. Check out some of these [iron meteorites for sale](https://www.meteorites-for-sale.com/iron-meteorites.html) or buy a piece of the [Campo Del Cielo meteorite on Amazon](https://a.co/d/4AVKM9i).
