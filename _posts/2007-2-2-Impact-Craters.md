title: Impact Craters

- Explore [9.3 Impact Craters](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/9-3-impact-craters) to learn about the cratering process and how it helps determine geological ages on the Moon and other celestial bodies.
- Why would astronomers think there were volcanoes on the moon? Isn't it obvious that they are impact craters? Well, volcanoes and impact craters look a lot alike. In fact, even on the earth, it can be easy to confuse the two. It happened to me when I went to Crater Lake National Park. Check out the video [Confusing Craters and Volcanoes](https://youtu.be/rF0qy-ETu8g)
- Read [9.4 The Origin of the Moon](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/9-4-the-origin-of-the-moon) to understand the giant impact hypothesis, which proposes the origin of the Moon from a collision with a Mars-sized object.
- Astronomers use simulations to model the formation of the moon. We can do the same thing with [Universe Sandbox](https://universesandbox.com/) - a space-based physics simulator / video game. The game isn't free, but there are a ton of videos across the web showing realistic astronomy simulations using Universe Sandbox. I've created my own simulation of the [Formation of the Moon](https://youtu.be/PbftrTKcReg).
