- The solar system contains billions of comets, which are best described as “dirty snowballs.” Comets only occasionally make their way into the inner solar system during their orbit around the sun. When they pass by the sun, they partially melt, forming a beautiful stream of material in the night sky. Check out some of [these beautiful images of comets](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSNbG0dM0r1aJxDP5-BRb_IXkCf-pdAFOCmP5kA8UKV_CiMnbdAf8S0HK3Fk4fC7cmpPc7nxB44G9Tu/pub?start=true&loop=false&delayms=3000). It’s no wonder that ancient people could not figure out where these bizarre and beautiful objects in the sky came from.
- Read [13.3 The “Long-Haired” Comets](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/13-3-the-long-haired-comets) to learn about the nature of comets, including their nucleus composition, formation of tails, and the ESA Rosetta mission's insights into Comet P67 (Churyumov-Gerasimenko).
- Explore [13.4 The Origin and Fate of Comets and Related Objects](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/13-4-the-origin-and-fate-of-comets-and-related-objects) to understand the origins of comets from the Oort cloud and Kuiper belt, their role as primitive solar system remnants, and their fate after multiple perihelion passages.
