title: The EM Spectrum
---

- Light is a very mysterious thing, and it took scientists many generations to completely understand its subtle features. In many ways, light behaves like a wave. Watch the teacher video [Light Waves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zprxyxtzu0Y) for an introduction to wave terminology and lightwaves. If you like, you can also play around with the [Wave on a String Simulator](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/wave-on-a-string/latest/wave-on-a-string_all.html) 
- Read [5.1 The Behavior of Light](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/5-1-the-behavior-of-light) to understand the dual nature of light as both waves and particles, the relationship between wavelength, frequency, and speed of light, and the principles governing the apparent brightness of light sources.
- The electromagnetic spectrum is one of the most amazing concepts in all of physics and astronomy. It connects seemingly different phenomenon like radio communication and x-ray imaging into a single framework. You've probably learned about the EM Spectrum before, but it's critical that you have a solid understanding of the full spectrum of light - from the longest wavelengths to the shortest. NASA created an excellent introduction to the EM Spectrum. While it is a bit dated, it is concise, well-made, and interesting. I encourage you to watch each of the following brief, 3-5 min videos: [Introduction](https://youtu.be/lwfJPc-rSXw?si=Tx8V2f4FFWzecuPk), [Radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzDmEA8x0nQ), [Microwave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZeBzTI5Omk), [Infrared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8caGm9Fmh0), [Visible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMtC34pzKGc), [Ultraviolet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QW5zeVy8aE0), [X-Ray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCAYcuCWOnM), and [Gamma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCAYcuCWOnM). 
- Explore [5.2 The Electromagnetic Spectrum](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/5-2-the-electromagnetic-spectrum) to read about the various types of electromagnetic radiation, their sources, and how temperature affects the emitted radiation.
