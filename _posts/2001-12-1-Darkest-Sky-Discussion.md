title: Darkest Sky Discussion
---

To introduce ourselves to one another, let's each share the story of the darkest sky you have ever seen. Where did you see it? How did it make you feel? Please share and then respond to at least one of your classmates. I'll go first...

As a graduate student studying astronomy, I spent a lot of time at [Kitt Peak National Observatory](https://photos.app.goo.gl/quppMJd7AqPmB8zd8) near Tucson, Arizona. While most of this time was spent inside a well-lit control room, controlling the telescopes and cameras over computers, I did take one night where I sat out in the darkness and let my eyes fully adjust to the night sky. I've never seen anything quite like it - the sky was truly glowing. The Milky Way was shining bright. It was a memorable experience for sure. The weirdest thing was that I was using a red light while allowing my eyes to adjust to the dark. When I eventually turned it off and looked at the sky, it was all glowing blue. Super cool.

Ok, now it's your turn. Go to our class discussion board and share your response.
