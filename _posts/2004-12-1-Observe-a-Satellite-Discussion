title: Observe a Satellite Discussion
---

Every night hundreds of satellites fly across the sky. If you simply look up to a dark sky and patiently watch, you can probably see a satellite in just a few minutes (so long as you know what to look for). For a reminder of what a satellite looks like in the sky, re-watch the video [Satellites in my Backyard](https://youtu.be/2SgfOIoAGok).

Under normal circumstances, you won’t see a bunch of bright satellites in a row like I did, but with some careful planning, you can definitely see at a bright satellite on any given night - and that’s exactly what you’re going to do for this discussion. Watch [this teacher video](https://youtu.be/48qmHsQnwEM?si=6hTInP6KbEuPQh9m) for a detailed explanation of how to complete this activity. You will use the website [Heavens-Above](https://www.heavens-above.com/) to plan your observations. (Please note that this activity must be completed on a clear night. Cloudy weather is not an acceptable excuse for failing to participate. :) Just try again on the next clear night.)

After observing your satellite, come back to the discussion board and share one (or more) of the following: 
- A photograph (or link to a video) that you captured of the satellite you observed in the sky, or 
- A written description and sketch of your satellite observation (When and where did you see it? How did its visibility compare to your expectations?), or
- Share some details about the satellite you observed (What was it?, What does it look like up close?, Where was it launched from?), or 
- What opinions do you have about the proliferation of satellites and its potential impact on astronomy. Here's [a NY Times story](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/17/science/astronomy-starlink-spacex-kuiper-amazon.html) about how mega constellations of satellites are impacting ground-based telescopes. 

You have a lot of choice in how you participate. I look forward to a lively discussion.
