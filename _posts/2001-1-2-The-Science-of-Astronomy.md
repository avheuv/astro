- Have you ever laid out at night and looked up at all the stars? What an awe-inspiring experience that is, right? Before we begin our course, I just want to take a moment to pause and reflect on those special places where we can go to connect with the night sky. I hope you have a spot that you can visit during this course… a place where you can just look up at the stars and wonder about it all. I’d like to take just a moment to show you my special place. Check out this teacher video: [My Favorite Place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IC8ohsuw_w).
- My love of astronomy was solidified when I read the famous Carl Sagan book, Cosmos. Sagan has a poetic way of describing humanity's intimate connection to the stars and the inevitabiity that we will one day become a spacefaring species. We will hear from Carl Sagan at various points throughout our course, but I want to give you a little taste in this video [Wanderers](https://youtu.be/YH3c1QZzRK4?si=xIPim-ZRBmsmhs2h)
- Explore [The Nature of Astronomy](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/1-1-the-nature-of-astronomy) to understand the study of celestial objects beyond Earth, their interactions, and the universe's evolutionary history from the Big Bang to the present, highlighting how science continually evolves with new discoveries and methodologies.
- Read [The Nature of Science](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/1-1-the-nature-of-astronomy) to understand how science operates as a method of understanding nature through observations, experiments, models, and testing, emphasizing that science evolves with new discoveries and methodologies.
