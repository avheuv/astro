- Read [24.2 Spacetime and Gravity](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/24-2-spacetime-and-gravity) to understand how Einstein's equivalence principle leads to the concept of curved spacetime.
- Explore [24.3 Tests of General Relativity](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/24-3-tests-of-general-relativity) to learn about experimental evidence supporting Einstein's general theory of relativity.
- Review [24.4 Time in General Relativity](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/24-4-time-in-general-relativity) to explore how gravity affects the flow of time according to general relativity.
