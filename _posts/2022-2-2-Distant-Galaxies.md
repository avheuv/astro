title: Distant Galaxies
---

- In our quest to understand the variety of galaxies in our universe, astronomers want to look deeper and deeper into space. As we learned at the start of our course, looking deeper into space has the dual benefits of seeing both farther away and farther ago - back in time. The James Webb Space Telescope now allows us to view deeper than even before. Watch [this news story on JWST from 60 Minutes](https://youtu.be/dC1-qgR7YO0?si=x7rggc7m20lmomQM), which highlights how the Webb Telescope is transofmring our understanding of distant galaxies and the early universe. 
- Read [28.1 Observations of Distant Galaxies](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/28-1-observations-of-distant-galaxies) to learn about how the color of galaxies indicates the age of their stars and the characteristics of galaxies observed in the early universe.
- Explore [28.2 Galaxy Mergers and Active Galactic Nuclei](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/28-2-galaxy-mergers-and-active-galactic-nuclei) to understand the role of galaxy collisions, mergers, and active galactic nuclei in the evolution of galaxies.
- Check out this incredible video, which compares [Simulations and Observations of Galaxy Collisions](https://youtu.be/C0XNyTp5brM?si=HRwxKNRwu6rlzJkR). (Note that there is no sound in the video.)
- I can't resist sharing another awesome simulation - this one showing [Four Galaxies Merging](https://youtu.be/YCbIjZEtmcY?si=JLfBxOTCQvSzGiZk).
- Review [28.3 The Distribution of Galaxies in Space](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/28-3-the-distribution-of-galaxies-in-space) for an explanation of the cosmological principle, the structure of galaxy clusters and superclusters, and the distribution of galaxies in the universe.
- Watch the SciShow Space clip [What if the Universe Isn't Uniform](https://youtu.be/YGVW4BaA0qA?si=ZJ1Fbcb62NCUFjGW) to learn more about the Cosmological Principle and recent observational challenges.
