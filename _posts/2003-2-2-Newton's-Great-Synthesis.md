title: Newton's Great Synthesis
---

- It is hard to overstate the importance of Isaac Newton in our modern understanding of physics and mathematics. Read the [3.2 Newton's Great Synthesis](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/3-2-newtons-great-synthesis) to learn about the man and his contributions to science.
- You've probably learned about Newton's Laws of Motions and the concept of density in a previous science class. These fundamental physics principles will pop from time-to-time in our astronomy class. Let's review these ideas using one of my favorite video games. Watch The Physics of "Osmos."
-  Another foundational physics principle that appears in astronomy is the Conservation of Angular Momentum. Here are three excellement demonstrations of the phenomenon: 1) [the spinning sphere](https://youtu.be/64t-dVtDwkQ?si=3D-BZpU4tZ7QWpPV&t=46), 2) [the spinning professor](https://youtu.be/M6PuutIm5h4?si=BIJ3YoUf0hCArjf8&t=5), and 3) [the spinning figure skater](https://youtu.be/49zi_73pm1Q?si=8QLHRXGv3xn8l7zr).
-  Explore [3.3 Newtonâ€™s Universal Law of Gravitation](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/3-3-newtons-universal-law-of-gravitation) to understand how gravity, described by Newton's law, governs the attraction between masses and influences celestial motions, enabling the calculation of astronomical object masses.
