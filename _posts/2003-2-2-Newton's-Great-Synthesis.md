title: Newton's Great Synthesis
---

- It is hard to overstate the importance of Isaac Newton in our modern understanding of physics and mathematics. Read the [3.2 Newton's Great Synthesis](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/3-2-newtons-great-synthesis) to learn about the man and his contributions to science.
- You've probably learned about Newton's Laws of Motions and the concept of density in a previous science class. These fundamental physics principles will pop from time-to-time in our astronomy class. Let's review these ideas using one of my favorite video games. Watch The Physics of "Osmos."
