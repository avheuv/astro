- Watch the video [Telescopes](https://youtu.be/f90eTYiAbU0?si=sYHEckKJlU7PU4Tu), where I take you on a field trip to my favorite telescope. Along the way, weâ€™ll see exactly what makes telescopes work the way they do. 
- Read [6.1 Telescopes](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/6-1-telescopes) to understand how telescopes collect and focus light from astronomical sources and the differences between refracting and reflecting telescopes.
- Watch [The Evolution of Telescope Mirrors](https://youtu.be/C5Q_48eW1V0?si=G6UGNkgZHkh4-3RD) to learn how professional astronomers and engineers are building enormous telescopes with cutting edge technology.
- The "Extremely Large Telescope" (ELT) shown in the previous video seems so big that it would never actually be built in real life, right? WRONG! - How dare you doubt the willpower of astronomers! It is currently under construction as you can see from [this 2023 update video.](https://youtu.be/ifOcSTowoAU?si=3aVMhwpTgWtw6PDq) 
- Explore [6.2 Telescopes Today](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/6-2-telescopes-today) to discover advancements in telescope technology since 1990, including the development of lightweight mirrors and the use of adaptive optics to counteract atmospheric turbulence.
