title: Astrology Experiment Discussion
---

Let's explore astrology, the belief that the positions of the planets influence human lives, by conducting a simple experiment. I have developed a precise astrophysical horoscope website (linked below), which generates personlized astrological readings based on the actual positions of the planets on your date of birth. The planetary data is pulled directly from [NASA JPL's Ephemerides](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/), which is the world-leading source on planetary positions. 

- Engage with Your Astrological Reading: Navigate to the [Precision Horoscope Website](https://storage.googleapis.com/avh-lessons/horoscope.html) and input your birth date to see your personalized reading. Take a moment to consider its accuracy and relevance to your personality and life. How closely does it align with your self-perception?
- Conduct an Experiment: Input the birth date of a friend or family member. Compare their personalized reading to yours. Do you think the precision horoscope tool works just as well for them as it worked for you? 
- Reflect, Share, and Discuss: On our discussion board, post a reflection on your experience with this experiment. Engage with your classmates in a debate about the scientific validity of horoscopes.
  
I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences and reading your reflections.
