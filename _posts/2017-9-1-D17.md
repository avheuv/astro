title: Modeling Star Formation Discussion
---

In this discussion, we're taking a hands-on approach to understanding the stages of star formation. You'll be using household items to create a physical model that depicts the process of how stars are born.

- Construct Your Model: Utilize any household items (or ingredients from the kitchen) to model three key stages of star formation: the accumulation of gas and dust, gravitational collapse, and the initiation of nuclear fusion. Think about how different objects can represent these complex astronomical processes.
- Document Your Model: For each stage of star formation you've modeled, take a photo that clearly shows how you've represented this part of the process. You will submit a total of three photos, one for each stage.
- Explain Your Model: Along with your photos, provide a detailed explanation of your model. For each stage, describe which household items you used and how they represent the specific aspect of star formation. 

After posting your model and explanations, take some time to explore and engage with the models created by your classmates. Offer comments to discuss the creative approaches and scientific interpretations seen in their models. This is an excellent opportunity to learn from each other and to see how a single scientific concept can be interpreted in multiple, creative ways.
