- Explore [19.4 The H–R Diagram and Cosmic Distances](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/19-4-the-h-r-diagram-and-cosmic-distances) to understand how the Hertzsprung-Russell (H–R) diagram is utilized in determining cosmic distances by establishing luminosity classes and temperatures of stars.
- Another way that astronomers can use H-R Diagrams to measure distances is through [Star Cluster Main Sequence Fitting](https://youtu.be/a-mHv6zCr2w). Check out the video and, if you like, you can [play with the simulation](https://astro.unl.edu/naap/distance/animations/clusterFittingExplorer.html) for yourself.
