title: Cosmic Distance Ladder
---

- Explore [19.4 The H–R Diagram and Cosmic Distances](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/19-4-the-h-r-diagram-and-cosmic-distances) to understand how the Hertzsprung-Russell (H–R) diagram is utilized in determining cosmic distances by establishing luminosity classes and temperatures of stars.
- Another way that astronomers can use H-R Diagrams to measure distances is through [Star Cluster Main Sequence Fitting](https://youtu.be/a-mHv6zCr2w). Check out the video and, if you like, you can [play with the simulation](https://astro.unl.edu/naap/distance/animations/clusterFittingExplorer.html) for yourself.
- One of the top rungs in our distance ladder is [Supernova Lightcurve Fitting](https://youtu.be/DSTPs5qw1DA), which allows us to accurately measure the distance to galaxies in the farthest reaches of the universe. If you'd like to play with the simulation from the video, you can [find it here](https://astro.unl.edu/naap/distance/animations/snCurveExplorer.html).
- Finally, watch this excellent summary of [The Cosmic Distance Ladder](https://youtu.be/rV-Z6jk9Fkw?si=_x1SBffEyaFQjawN) from SciShow.
