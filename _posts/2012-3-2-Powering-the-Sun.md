- Let's review some basic concepts of energy. Watch my [Energy Transfer](https://youtu.be/n44K8Irpgpw?si=fvT7xBAElyhPVx5F) video to see how energy can seemlessly transition between various forms.
- Then watch my [Energy Conversion video](https://youtu.be/oFpr1FaT3T0?si=51JVghYky_I9I7XP) to see how mechanical energy can be transformed into thermal energy. 
- Read [16.1 Sources of Sunshine: Thermal and Gravitational Energy](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/16-1-sources-of-sunshine-thermal-and-gravitational-energy) to discover how early scientists struggled to explain the source of the sun's tremendous energy.
- In 1905, at age 26, Albert Einstein published four significant papers in physics. Some have said that any one of the papers could have earned Einstein a Nobel Prize. One of these papers, entitled "Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon its Energy Content" made a startling suggestion: that mass is another form of energy. This is expressed in perhaps the most famous equation of all time, E = mc^2. This equation implies that the mass contained in just a pinch of salt is equivalent to the energy required to run a lightbulb for 50,000 years. 
- Explore [16.2 Mass, Energy, and the Theory of Relativity](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/16-2-mass-energy-and-the-theory-of-relativity) to learn about the fusion reactions that power the Sun and how mass is converted into energy according to Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2.
