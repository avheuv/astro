- Let's review some basic concepts of energy. Watch my [Energy Transfer](https://youtu.be/n44K8Irpgpw?si=fvT7xBAElyhPVx5F) video to see how energy can seamlessly transition between various forms. Then watch my [Energy Conversion video](https://youtu.be/oFpr1FaT3T0?si=51JVghYky_I9I7XP) to see how mechanical energy can be transformed into thermal energy. 
- Read [16.1 Sources of Sunshine: Thermal and Gravitational Energy](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/16-1-sources-of-sunshine-thermal-and-gravitational-energy) to discover how early scientists struggled to explain the source of the sun's tremendous energy.
- Watch the brief NOVA clip [The Sun's Energy](https://youtu.be/iQhgd8A5yNg) to learn about the actual source of solar power.
- In 1905, at age 26, Albert Einstein published four significant papers in physics. Some have said that any one of the papers could have earned Einstein a Nobel Prize. One of these papers, entitled "Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon its Energy Content" made a startling suggestion: that mass is another form of energy. This is expressed in perhaps the most famous equation of all time, E = mc^2. This equation implies that the mass contained in just a pinch of salt is equivalent to the energy required to run a lightbulb for 50,000 years. Watch this brief video clip where [Einstein Describes E=mc^2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RO8OVoQlXc). 
- Explore [16.2 Mass, Energy, and the Theory of Relativity](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/16-2-mass-energy-and-the-theory-of-relativity) to learn about the fusion reactions that power the Sun. I don't expect you to fully understand the nuclear reactions (proton-proton chain or the CNO cycle). 
- Fusion is able to turn a small amount of matter into a tremendous amount of energy. If humans can master and control the process of fusion, we could generate limitless energy without any waste or pollutants. Watch the 60 Minutes story [Inside the breakthrough that could change our world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kh6Ik4-yag) to learn about the National Ignition Facility and its attempts to create stable fusion power here on earth.
