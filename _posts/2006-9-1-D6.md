title: Life in the Universe Debate
---

This discussion will be a lively debate on the existence of life beyond our planet. I want to challenge you to think broadly about "alien life" throughout this debate. Let's try to avoid the trap of talking only about UFOs and aliens - although you are welcome to discuss that - but let's also be sure to address the question of life through a more scientific lens, including forms of life like plants, grass, microbes, etc. 

- **Present Your Perspective:** Share your thoughts on the existence of extraterrestrial life, supporting your position with reasoning and evidence. Consider incorporating ideas from science, philosophy, or personal intuition to enrich the discussion.
- **Engage in the Debate:** Read and respond to at least three of your classmates’ posts. Challenge their arguments, pose questions, or provide additional insights to create a dynamic and interactive conversation.
- **Foster Respectful Dialogue:** While debating differing viewpoints, remember to maintain a constructive and respectful tone. The goal is to explore this topic together in a way that is both stimulating and enjoyable.

This is your opportunity to dive into one of the most fascinating questions in astronomy. Let’s hear your take!
