- You’ve no doubt heard of Albert Einstein before. His name and likeness have become synonymous with “genius.” The story, as it is often told, is that Einstein was an uncommon prodigy who didn’t take school seriously. His success in physics came early and was somewhat miraculous. In 1905, at the age of 26, Einstein had his “Annus Mirabilis” (miracle year) in which he published multiple original scientific papers - any one of which was significant enough to have earned him the Nobel Prize.
- Historians have discovered, though, that Einstein’s story is a little more complicated (and a lot more interesting) than what we’ve been told in the past. They say, “Behind every great man is a great woman,” and this seems to have been especially true of Einstein. Read the article, “[The Forgotten Life of Einstein’s First Wife](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nso-wk3KXjNuubLdxDT6gm_5JnJOqh7frigFsi3Rz1w/edit?usp=sharing)” from Scientific American.
- While many important discoveries are attributed to Einstein, none have revolutionized our fundamental understanding of the universe more than Special and General Relativity. Before we can understand “Special Relativity,” we first need to consider plain old “relativity” (sometimes called “Newtonian Relativity”.) The core idea is that the laws of physics are the same for all “inertial reference frames.” Watch the video [Frames of Reference](https://youtu.be/x_6ul0lqzjI) for an introduction to what that means.
- Read [24.1 Introducing General Relativity](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/24-1-introducing-general-relativity) to understand Einstein's equivalence principle and its implications for the theory of general relativity.
