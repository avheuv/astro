- Explore [27.1 Quasars](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/27-1-quasars) to learn about the discover of the very bright, very distant objects that have come to be known as "quasars."
- The energy reqired to power a quasar can only come from a supermassive black hole - a black hole that contains the mass of millions of stars. Watch [this brief video](https://youtu.be/gFjUpGAW-7w?si=7xHPkd3ml965MU1n) that connects the teminology of black holes with the terminology of quasars and "active galactic nuclei." 
- Read [27.2 Supermassive Black Holes: What Quasars Really Are](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/27-2-supermassive-black-holes-what-quasars-really-are) to learn about the role of supermassive black holes in powering quasars and the formation of accretion disks.
- Review [27.3 Quasars as Probes of Evolution in the Universe](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/27-3-quasars-as-probes-of-evolution-in-the-universe) to understand how quasars and galaxies interact, their implications for galaxy formation, and the triggers for quasar activity.
