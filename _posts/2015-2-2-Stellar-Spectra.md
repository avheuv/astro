title: Stellar Spectra

- Measuring the color of a star is just the beginning of understanding its properties. Watch the BBC clip [Spectroscopy of Stars](https://youtu.be/n_KyYFYNvpI?si=o6-sTAjERs5VOMzl) to see how a more detailed study of the color of stars leads us to stellar spectra. 
- Review [17.3 The Spectra of Stars (and Brown Dwarfs)](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/17-3-the-spectra-of-stars-and-brown-dwarfs) to understand how differences in temperature affect the spectra of stars and the classification system used to categorize them.
- Explore [17.4 Using Spectra to Measure Stellar Radius, Composition, and Motion](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/17-4-using-spectra-to-measure-stellar-radius-composition-and-motion) to learn how stellar spectra can be used to determine the size, composition, and motion of stars, including the Doppler effect and proper motion.
- Watch the video [Stars from Crash Course Astronomy](https://youtu.be/ld75W1dz-h0?si=7FSo46UDKKYINUd8), which provides a helpful summary of stellar spectroscopy and gives us a sneak peek of where this is all headed later in our unit - the HR Diagram.
