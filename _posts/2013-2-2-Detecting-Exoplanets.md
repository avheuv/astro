title: Detecting Exoplanets
---

- The detection and discovery of planets around other stars has only become possible in my life time. There are two primary methods used to discover exoplanets - the Doppler Method and the Transit Method.
- Watch this video [Introduction to the Doppler Method](https://youtu.be/3LkGjPy04nI) of detecting exoplanets (also known as the "Radial Velocity Method.")
- Then watch this video for an [Introduction to the Transit Method]() of discovering exoplanets.
- Read [21.4 Planets beyond the Solar System: Search and Discovery](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/21-4-planets-beyond-the-solar-system-search-and-discovery) for an overview of observational techniques used to detect exoplanets, including direct and indirect methods such as the Doppler and transit techniques.
