title: Final Reflection Discussion
---

As we reach the conclusion of our course, it's time for a moment of reflection. This final discussion is not about recounting the facts and figures we've learned but rather about exploring the deeper, personal transformations we've experienced through our engagement with astronomy.

- **Reflect on Personal Change:** Consider how interacting with the course material has influenced your perspective or understanding of the world. Have you noticed any shifts in your thinking or approach to learning?
- **Assess Your View of Science:** Reflect on how your perception of science, and astronomy in particular, has changed since the beginning of this class. Discuss any new appreciations, questions, or critiques that have emerged for you during our time together.
- **Identify Key Takeaways:** Pinpoint the most impactful lesson or insight you've gained from this course. Describe why this stands out to you and how you anticipate it will influence you in the future.

This discussion is a chance to collectively celebrate our growth and the broadening of our horizons. After posting your reflections, engage with at least one of your classmates' contributions. This can be an opportunity to find common ground, offer encouragement, or simply appreciate the diverse ways in which the study of the cosmos can influence us.
