title: Birthday Sky Discussion
---

Let's use Stellarium to look up exactly what the sky looked like on the night you were born. 
-- Open [Stellarium Web](https://stellarium-web.org/)
-- Change the date to the date and year of your birth.
-- Shift the time to be 2-3 hours after sunset.
-- Explore the sky. Was the moon visible? What phase was it in? What were the most dominant constellations of the sky that night? Were any bright planets visible?
-- Take a screenshot of your Birthday Sky and then return to our course discussion board.

In the discussion forum, post your screenshot and your observations. Make special note of anything interesting you noticed about the sky on the night you were born.
