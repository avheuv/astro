- Watch the video [Measuring Distances in the Universe](https://youtu.be/SyN-If_ePZw) for an introduction to measuring cosmic distances and the critical role that variable stars play in this process.
- Read [19.3 Variable Stars: One Key to Cosmic Distances](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/19-3-variable-stars-one-key-to-cosmic-distances) to explore how Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars are used as standard candles to determine cosmic distances, providing insights into the vast scales of the universe.
- Watch the video [Henrietta Leavitt - Ahead of her time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQv03YqEPNM) to learn more about her essential contribution to our understanding of the cosmos.
- Discovering variable stars and measuring their light curves is an interesting process. Watch the video [Variable Star Photometry](https://youtu.be/wto-4TSkf-E) to learn how astronomers perform this kind of analysis. If you like, you can play with [the simulators](https://astro.unl.edu/naap/vsp/vsp.html) for yourself.
