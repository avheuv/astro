- There is a long and fascinating history of Mars exploration that stretches back to the very beginning of the space age. Watch [this 25-min teacher video](https://youtu.be/UMhXoNL4JZQ?t=13), which walks through the dramatic evolution of space missions to the red planet. 
- Explore [10.4 The Geology of Mars](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/10-4-the-geology-of-mars) to learn about Mars's heavily cratered highlands, volcanic plains, massive Tharsis bulge, and the Valles Marineris canyons, along with the search for evidence of past water.
- On first inspection, Mars looks a lot like Mercury and the Moon. Explore [this map of the surface of Mars](https://www.google.com/maps/space/mars/). Zoom in and take particular note of the many craters, big and small that cover the planet Mars.
- Explore some of the incredible images from the [Mars Rover Image Gallery](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/images/index.html), which illustrate how the surface of Mars is a barren desert-like landscape.
- If we look closer at Mars, though, we see evidence that it was once an active, violent place. Watch the BBC video [Olympus Mons on Mars](https://storage.googleapis.com/avh-astro-videos/Olympus%20Mons%20on%20Mars.webm), which introduces the biggest volcano in our Solar System.
- Review [10.5 Water and Life on Mars](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/10-5-water-and-life-on-mars) to understand the martian atmosphere, seasonal polar caps, evidence of past water erosion features, and the search for signs of past and present life on the Red Planet.
- Read [10.6 Divergent Planetary Evolution](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/10-6-divergent-planetary-evolution) to explore how Earth, Venus, and Mars have evolved differently from similar beginnings and the implications for understanding planetary environments.
