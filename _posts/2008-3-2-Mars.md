- There is a long and fascinating history of Mars exploration that stretches back to the very beginning of the space age. Watch [this 25-min teacher video](https://youtu.be/UMhXoNL4JZQ?t=13), which walks through the dramatic evolution of space missions to the red planet. 
- Explore [10.4 The Geology of Mars](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/10-4-the-geology-of-mars) to learn about Mars's heavily cratered highlands, volcanic plains, massive Tharsis bulge, and the Valles Marineris canyons, along with the search for evidence of past water.
- Explore some of the incredible images from the [Mars Rover Image Gallery](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/images/index.html), which illustrate how the surface of Mars is a barren desert-like landscape.
- Mars was once an active, violent place. Watch the BBC video [Olympus Mons on Mars](https://storage.googleapis.com/avh-astro-videos/Olympus%20Mons%20on%20Mars.webm), which introduces the biggest volcano in our Solar System.
- Review [10.5 Water and Life on Mars](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/10-5-water-and-life-on-mars) to understand the martian atmosphere, seasonal polar caps, evidence of past water erosion features, and the search for signs of past and present life on the Red Planet.
- Mars clearly has an atmosphere (albeit a very thin one), which causes weather on Mars. One of the most interesting weather phenomena on Mars are the tiny tornado-like “dust devils.” Check out [this amazing picture](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/The_Serpent_Dust_Devil_on_Mars_PIA15116.jpg) and [video](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Marsdustdevil2.gif) of Martian dust devils. 
- There is mounting evidence that there has been (and still is) liquid water on the surface of Mars - at least during some parts of the year. Watch the video [Water on Mars](https://youtu.be/DzEpbhcIcPc?t=13) to see the evidence.
- Read [10.6 Divergent Planetary Evolution](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/10-6-divergent-planetary-evolution) to explore how Earth, Venus, and Mars have evolved differently from similar beginnings and the implications for understanding planetary environments.
- If we understand the evolution of planets, perhaps we can someday "terraform" Mars to make it more like the earth. Watch the video [Terraforming Mars](https://youtu.be/40VBVxFJK0g?si=0b41mO4cz7swClqx&t=13) to see how this could (and yet probably won't) work.
