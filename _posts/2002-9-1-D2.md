title: Observing a Constellation Discussion
---

For this discussion, we’re venturing outside to observe a constellation firsthand. This represents a chance for us to practice using tools like a star wheel or Stellarium-Web. Sharing this experience with a friend or family member could make it even more enjoyable. So grab a coat, a cell phone, and a friend and head outside. 

**Your task:**
- Select and Observe a Constellation: Head outside on a clear morning or evening to find and observe a constellation. Use aids like a [star wheel](https://storage.googleapis.com/avh-agli/agli/starwheel/index.html) or [Stellarium-Web](https://stellarium-web.org/) to assist you in finding the constellation.
- Document Your Discovery: Use a cell phone to capture two photos: 1) a picture of the constellation in the sky, and 2) a selfie of you (and any of your observing buddies) making your observations. Don't worry, your photo of the constellation doesn't have to be awesome - but if you play with your camera settings a little and rest the cell phone on something solid, you'll be surprised how nice of a photo you can capture.
- Share and Reflect: Post your photos to the discussion board. Along with the pictrues, include a brief description naming the chosen constellation, the date and time of your observation, and the tools you used. Reflect on any challenges you faced in identifying or finding the constellation and describe how you overcame them.

Note that, if you prefer, you can draw a picture of the constellation you observed, and upload a photo of that.)I’m eager to begin our celestial journey with your observations. Sharing these experiences will not only enrich our class but also deepen our connection to the universe and each other. Let’s uncover the wonders of the night sky together!
