title: Observing a Constellation Discussion
---

For this discussion, weâ€™re venturing outside to observe a constellation firsthand. This is a chance for us to practice using tools like a star wheel or Stellarium-Web with the real night sky. Sharing this experience with a friend or family member will make it even more enjoyable. So grab a coat, a cell phone, and a friend and head outside! 

- Select and Observe a Constellation: Head outside on a clear morning or evening to observe a constellation. Use aids like a [star wheel](https://storage.googleapis.com/avh-agli/agli/starwheel/index.html) or [Stellarium-Web](https://stellarium-web.org/) to assist you in locating the constellation in the sky.
- Document Your Discovery: Use a cell phone to capture two photos: 1) a picture of the constellation, and 2) a selfie of you (and any of your observing buddies) making your observations. Don't worry, your photo of the constellation doesn't have to be awesome - but if you play with your camera settings a little and rest the cell phone on something solid, you'll be surprised how nice of a photo you can capture.
- Share and Reflect: Post your photos to the discussion board. Along with the pictures, include a brief description naming the constellation your chose, the date and time of your observation, and the tools you used. Reflect on any challenges you faced in finding the constellation and describe how you overcame them.

I'm eager to hear about your experiences! Note that if you have any concerns about taking these photographs or sharing them on the discussion board, you can instead draw a picture of the constellation you observed, and upload a photo of that.
