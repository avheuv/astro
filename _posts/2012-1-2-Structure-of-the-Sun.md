- As we begin our study of the sun, watch this video showing the [Sun through a solar telescope](https://youtu.be/pA0rMhTDNQ8).
- Astronomers use much larger solar telescopes to study the sun. One of my favorite solar telescopes is the [McMath-Pierce Solar Telescope](https://noirlab.edu/public/images/archive/search/?adv=&subject_name=McMath-Pierce%20Solar%20Telescope) at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Tucson, Arizona.
- Explore [15.1 The Structure and Composition of the Sun](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/15-1-the-structure-and-composition-of-the-sun) to learn about the layers and composition of the Sun, including its core, radiative zone, convective zone, photosphere, chromosphere, transition region, and corona, as well as its solar wind and the phenomenon of auroras on Earth.
