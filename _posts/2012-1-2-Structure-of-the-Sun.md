- As we begin our study of the sun, watch this video showing the [Sun through a solar telescope](https://youtu.be/pA0rMhTDNQ8).
- Astronomers use much larger solar telescopes to study the sun. One of my favorite solar telescopes is the [McMath-Pierce Solar Telescope](https://noirlab.edu/public/images/archive/search/?adv=&subject_name=McMath-Pierce%20Solar%20Telescope) at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Tucson, Arizona.
- Watch the video [Solar Space Telescopes](https://youtu.be/FUpEG7-5Xmg) to learn about the current state-of-the-art in solar observing. 
- Explore [15.1 The Structure and Composition of the Sun](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/15-1-the-structure-and-composition-of-the-sun) to learn about the layers and composition of the Sun, including its core, radiative zone, convective zone, photosphere, chromosphere, transition region, and corona, as well as its solar wind and the phenomenon of auroras on Earth.
- Our reading describes the many layers of the sun. Thanks to our amazing solar space telescopes, we have incredible images and videos of many of these layers. Check out the NOVA clip [Anatomy of the Sun](https://youtu.be/crPzN0Ia8tQ) to see some of this incredible footage.
- Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin is considered a hero of astronomy for her foundational discovery about the nature of stars. She was also a pioneer for women in science. Watch the brief biography, [Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin - Influential Women in Astronomy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CD48phR6rY) describing her achievements.
