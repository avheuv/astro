title: Regular and Substantial Interaction
---
I love interacting with students (that's why I'm a teacher). Throughout this course, I will maintain "regular and substantial interaction" with you through:  
- **Announcements:** I will regularly post class announcements that summarize key concepts, preview upcoming units, share current events in astronomy, and address trends that I see in your coursework. 
- **Discussions:** I will participate in and facilitate our weekly class discussions, offering my perspective and feedback on the topics we discuss.
- **Feedback & Monitoring:** I will initiate contact with you throughout the semester to provide you with personalized feedback on your coursework and to discuss your progress in the course.
- **Office Hours:** I will host regularly scheduled office hours every Thursday at 4:00 pm Eastern Time.  You can meet me in my [virtual office in Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/yoc-sytg-mvb). During this time, I can provide direct instruction and respond to any questions you have about the course. Office Hours are optional (our class is asynchronous and has no required synchronous online meetings). If this day and time does not work for you, send me a message, and we can arrange another time to meet.
- **Canvas Inbox:** I can respond to your questions and provide additional information through the Canvas Inbox. I check messages daily (M-F), so you can be sure I will respond to you within 24 hours. I avoid working on the weekends, so if you message me on Saturday or Sunday, I will not respond until Monday. If there is a true emergency, or you urgently need help to meet a due date, don't worry. Just send me a Canvas message like normal. I will respond and provide the flexibility you need.
