title: Regular and Substantial Interaction
---
I love interacting with students (that's why I'm a teacher), and there are lots of ways for us to interact in this course. My goal is to maintain "regular and substantial interaction" with you. Here are the primary ways we will do that: 
- **Announcements:** I will regularly post class announcements that summarize key concepts, preview upcoming units, share current events that relate to our course content, and address trends that I am seeing in your coursework. 
- **Discussions:** Engaging discussions are a cornerstone of this course. I will facilitate and participate in those discussions, sharing my own answers to the prompts, and commenting on your responses.
- **Personalized Feedback:** I will offer personalized feedback on course assignments. I will also initiate contact with you throughout the semester to discuss your progress and address any questions you may have.
- **Canvas Inbox:** Throughout our class, we will communicate through the Canvas inbox. This will allow me to provide information or respond to questions about the content of the course. I check messages daily, Monday through Friday, and I will respond with 24 hours during the week. I avoid working on the weekends, so if you message me on Saturday or Sunday, I will not respond until Monday. If there is a true emergency, or you urgently need help to meet a due date, don't worry. Just send me a Canvas message like normal. I will respond and provide the flexibility you need.
- - **Office Hours:** Our class is asynchronous, meaning that there are no required online zoom sessions. However, I am available to meet with you online via Zoom. Just send me a message via the Canvas Inbox and we can schedule a time to meet.
