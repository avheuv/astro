title: Regular and Substantial Interaction
---

- I love interacting with students (that's why I'm a teacher), and there are lots of ways for us to interact in this course. My goal is to maintain regular and substantial interaction with you, and this is how we will make sure that happens. 
#### How You Can Contact Me
- I prefer to be contacted by the **Canvas Inbox**
- I check messages daily, **Monday - Friday**, so you can rest assured that I will respond **within 24 hours** during the week.
- I avoid working on the weekends, so if you message me on Saturday or Sunday, **I will not respond until Monday.**
- If there is a true emergency, or you urgently need help to meet a due date, don't worry. Just send me a Canvas message like normal. I will respond and provide the flexibility you need.
#### How I Will Ensure Regular Substantial Interaction
- I will post **weekly announcements** related to the course content
- I will facilitate our **weekly discussions** in Canvas
- I will moderate and respond to comments on my **video lectures + discussions** posted to YouTube
- I will maintain an (optional) **weekly live Zoom session** for any students who would like to discuss the latest topics in our course
