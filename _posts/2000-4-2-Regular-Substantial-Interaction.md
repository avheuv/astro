title: Regular and Substantial Interaction
---
I love interacting with students (that's why I'm a teacher). Throughout this course, I will maintain "regular and substantial interaction" with you through the following activities:  
- **Announcements:** I will regularly post class announcements that summarize key concepts, preview upcoming units, share current events in astronomy, and address trends that I am seeing in your coursework. 
- **Discussions:** Engaging discussions are a cornerstone of this course. I will facilitate those discussions, sharing my own answers to the prompts, and commenting on your responses.
- **Personalized Feedback:** I will initiate contact with you throughout the semester to provide you with feedback and discuss your progress in the course.
- **Office Hours:** I invite you to join me at my regularly scheduled office hours every Thursday at 4:00 pm.  We will meet in my [virtual office in Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/yoc-sytg-mvb). During this time, I can provide direct instruction and respond to questions about the course. If this schedule office hours time does not work for you, send me a message and we can arrange another time to meet.
- **Canvas Inbox:** Throughout our class, we will communicate through the Canvas inbox. I check messages daily (M-F), so you can be sure I will respond to you within 24 hours. I avoid working on the weekends, so if you message me on Saturday or Sunday, I will not respond until Monday. If there is a true emergency, or you urgently need help to meet a due date, don't worry. Just send me a Canvas message like normal. I will respond and provide the flexibility you need.
