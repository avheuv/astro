title: Regular and Substantial Interaction
---
I love interacting with students (that's why I'm a teacher), and there are lots of ways for us to interact in this course. My goal is to maintain **regular and substantial interaction** with you, and this is how we will make sure that happens.  
- I will post **weekly announcements** related to the course content
- I will **initiate contact** with you during the semester to check in on your progress and see if you have any questions
- I will participate in our **weekly discussions** in Canvas
- I will moderate and respond to comments on my **video lectures + discussions** posted to YouTube
- I will maintain an (optional) **weekly live Zoom session** for any students who would like to discuss the latest topics in our course
## How You Can Contact Me
Of course, you should also feel free to contact me at any time throughout our course. Here's what you need to know.
- I prefer to be contacted by the **Canvas Inbox**
- I check messages daily, **Monday - Friday**, so you can rest assured that I will respond **within 24 hours** during the week.
- I avoid working on the weekends, so if you message me on Saturday or Sunday, **I will not respond until Monday.**
- If there is a true emergency, or you urgently need help to meet a due date, don't worry. Just send me a Canvas message like normal. I will respond and provide the flexibility you need.
