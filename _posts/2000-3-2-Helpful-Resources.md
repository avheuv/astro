- **Textbook**: Our course uses the free and open online textbook, [OpenStax Astronomy](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/1-introduction). The online version works very well with computers or mobile devices. However, if you prefer, you can follow the links on [this page](https://openstax.org/details/books/astronomy-2e) to download a PDF of the textbook or order an affordable printed copy. 
-  **Key Terms and Chapter Summaries**: At the end of every chapter of our textbook, you will find sections entitled "Key Terms" and "Summary." Reviewing these section at the beginning and/or end of a unit can be helpful.
-  **Traditional Lecture Videos**: Throughout our course, you will find that my lecture videos are short, (hopefully) engaging, and complimentary to your readings. You may, however, prefer a more traditional approach to lectures, which uses PowerPoint Slides to walk through all of the concepts. Here is an extensive list of [traditional lecture videos](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m5yNAc7n-uRuDu8snzbkoA2Vj3wWpK0--D4IB1kA9uo/edit?usp=sharing) from two different college professors, aligned to the chapters of our textbook. Please note, however, that all of the tests and quizzes in our course will be based on the videos that I have provided for you. These video should only be used as a supplement. 
-  **Crash Course Astronomy**: If you are looking for further "YouTube-style" video supplements to our course, then I would recommend the [Crash Course Astronomy video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtPAJr1ysd5yGIyiSFuh0mIL).
