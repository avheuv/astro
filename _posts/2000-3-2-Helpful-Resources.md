- **Textbook Formats**: Our course uses the free and open online textbook, [OpenStax Astronomy](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/1-introduction). The online version works very well with computers or mobile devices. However, if you prefer, you can follow the links on [this page](https://openstax.org/details/books/astronomy-2e) to download a PDF of the textbook or order an affordable printed copy. 
-  **Key Terms and Chapter Summaries**: At the end of every chapter of our textbook, you will find sections entitled "Key Terms" and "Summary." Reviewing these section at the beginning and/or end of a unit can be helpful.
