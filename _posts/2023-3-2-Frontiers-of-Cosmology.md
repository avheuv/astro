- Read [29.5 What Is the Universe Really Made Of?](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/29-5-what-is-the-universe-really-made-of) to learn about the composition of the universe, including the role of dark matter and ongoing efforts to detect weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs).
- Read [29.6 The Inflationary Universe](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/29-6-the-inflationary-universe) to understand the concept of inflation, which proposes rapid expansion in the early universe, and its implications for cosmology.
- Watch this brief video in which Alan Guth, the originator of inflation, explains [The Theory of Inflation](https://youtu.be/rEXDgpttmyc?si=KJiwpUSUAF0yuqk1).
- One of the amazing features of our universe is that the constants of nature including the cosmological constants appear to be very precisely tuned to support the development of stars, planets, and ultimately life. Watch the video [The Fine Tuning of the Universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rhbls0VQKPw).
- The leading scientific explanation for fine tuning is a theory known as the “multiverse.” Of course, the multiverse is a familiar concept to any fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but the idea is taken quite seriously by scientists. The basic premise is that our entire universe is just one of an infinite number of universes. Watch the video [Do we live in a multiverse?](https://youtu.be/-_OLc2P_CnE?si=dQbD5j81f1m8TNuA), in which leading cosmologists explain several variations of the core theory.
- Read [29.7 The Anthropic Principle](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/29-7-the-anthropic-principle) to review the ideas of fine tuning and the multiverse.
