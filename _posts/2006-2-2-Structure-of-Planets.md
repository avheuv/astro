title: Structure of Planets

- One awesome way to explore planets in our solar system is with Google Maps. The secret is that you have to zoom way out. (No, I'm not joking). Check out the brief video, [Google Space](https://youtu.be/n-YOP8Yx0lo) to see how you can access beautiful satellite imagery of planets & moons throughout our solar system. 
- Explore [7.2 Composition and Structure of Planets](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/7-2-composition-and-structure-of-planets) to understand the internal compositions of giant and terrestrial planets, the differentiation process, and the factors influencing surface temperatures and geological activity.
- To understand the internal structure of planets, it is important to wrap your head around the idea of differentiation. Check out this video demonstration, [Planetary Differentiation in a Cup of Coffee](https://youtu.be/f-OZKtZK4aY). 
- Review [7.3 Dating Planetary Surfaces](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/7-3-dating-planetary-surfaces) to learn about methods for estimating the ages of planetary surfaces, including crater counting and radioactive dating techniques, and to explore the estimated age of the Moon and Earth.
- Watch [Dating Planetary Surfaces with Impact Craters](https://youtu.be/5l91mtiVG3c) to see how images of the moon's surface can be used to determine the relative age of various regions. 
- Read [7.4 Origin of the Solar System](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/7-4-origin-of-the-solar-system) for insights into the formation of the solar system from a giant cloud of gas and dust called the solar nebula, the coalescence of planetesimals into planets and moons, and comparisons with other planetary systems.
