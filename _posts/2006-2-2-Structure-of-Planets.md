- Review [7.3 Dating Planetary Surfaces](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/7-3-dating-planetary-surfaces) to learn about methods for estimating the ages of planetary surfaces, including crater counting and radioactive dating techniques, and to explore the estimated age of the Moon and Earth.

- Read [7.4 Origin of the Solar System](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/7-4-origin-of-the-solar-system) for insights into the formation of the solar system from a giant cloud of gas and dust called the solar nebula, the coalescence of planetesimals into planets and moons, and comparisons with other planetary systems.
