title: Mass of the Galaxy

- Review [25.3 The Mass of the Galaxy](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/25-3-the-mass-of-the-galaxy) to understand how the mass of the Milky Way Galaxy is determined, including the contribution of dark matter, which makes up a significant portion of the total mass.
- Earlier in our course we learned about "stellar-mass black holes" - that is, a black hole with the mass of a single star. Astronomers have discovered compelling evidence that there are "supermassive black holes" in the center of many galaxies, including our own Milky Way. A single supermassive black hole can contain the mass of millions of stars (yes, millions)! Watch the NOVA clip [Monster of the Milky Way](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CbI0NjgyMxRmLkxylyIgd0s1VScKX1jx), which shows how astronomers can prove that our own galaxy has a supermassive black hole, even though no one can see it directly. (Be sure to watch to the end of the video for the amazing proof that these supermassive black holes exist.)
- Explore [25.4 The Center of the Galaxy](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/25-4-the-center-of-the-galaxy) to read about the presence of the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, as indicated by measurements of stellar velocities and radio observations.
