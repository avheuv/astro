- Review [17.3 The Spectra of Stars (and Brown Dwarfs)](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/17-3-the-spectra-of-stars-and-brown-dwarfs) to understand how differences in temperature affect the spectra of stars and the classification system used to categorize them.
- Explore [17.4 Using Spectra to Measure Stellar Radius, Composition, and Motion](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/17-4-using-spectra-to-measure-stellar-radius-composition-and-motion) to learn how stellar spectra can be used to determine the size, composition, and motion of stars, including the Doppler effect and proper motion.
