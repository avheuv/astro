title: Living Worlds Discussion
---

Wherever we find life on Earth, we discover that it has adapted perfectly to the environment in which it lives. In our study of astronomy, however, we have encountered some very unusual places. If life were to exist in one of these extraterrestrial environments, it must have adapted some unusual traits in order to survive under such unusual conditions. In this project, you will imagine your own new life form that is perfectly adapted to thrive in a strange extraterrestrial environment. To begin, read the brief descriptions below of three potentially habitable worlds.

<ins>Europa</ins>: One of Jupiter's largest Moons, Europa is covered with a thick layer of ice. Jupiter's strong gravity likely heats the interior of the moon, leading many astronomers to speculate that there may be a vast water ocean beneath the ice capable of supporting life.
 
 <ins>Proxima b</ins>: The nearest extrasolar planet to Earth, Proxima b is only slightly larger than our home planet, but it orbits its host star once every 11 days. It is likely to be small and rocky and could possibly possess an atmosphere, but it is known to be bombarded by radiation from its star. Liquid water could exist on the surface, but the planet is likely to be very hot.
 
 <ins>Draugr (PSR B1257+12 A)</ins>: Perhaps one of the strangest planets ever found, Draugr is only 1.5 times the size of the Moon. It orbits around a pulsar and so it would seem that there is no bright daytime, but only night. All life on Earth fundamentally depends on energy from our Sun, so any life on Draugr must have found a creative mechanism for harvesting energy to survive.
