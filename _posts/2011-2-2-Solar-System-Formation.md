title: Solar System Formation
---

- Read [14.3 Formation of the Solar System](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/14-3-formation-of-the-solar-system) for a detailed summary of the process of solar system formation. This brings together many topics from previous chapters into a single cohesive narrative.
- One surprising detail from the reading is that "it is difficult to explain the presence of water on Earth and Mars." Watch the video [Wait, why didn't the primordial earth have water?](https://youtu.be/Fhy63R7cONI)
- Explore [14.4 Comparison with Other Planetary Systems](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/14-4-comparison-with-other-planetary-systems) to learn about exoplanets and how their characteristics, such as hot Jupiters and eccentric orbits, differ from those in our own solar system, providing insights into planetary migration and the abundance of terrestrial rocky planets in the galaxy.
