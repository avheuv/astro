title: Warping Spacetime
---

- Read [24.2 Spacetime and Gravity](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/24-2-spacetime-and-gravity) to understand how Einstein's equivalence principle leads to the concept of curved spacetime.
- One of the best analogies of General Relativity is that matter warps space-time and what we experience as “gravity” is simply the most natural (“straight-line”) path through this curved space. This is demonstrated beautifully in the [Gravity Visualization Demo](https://youtu.be/MTY1Kje0yLg) (you don’t have to watch the entire thing, although the whole first half is pretty cool).
- Explore [24.3 Tests of General Relativity](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/24-3-tests-of-general-relativity) to learn about experimental evidence supporting Einstein's general theory of relativity.
- Watch this excellent video, which describes [The eclipse photos that made Einstein famous](https://youtu.be/HLxvq_M4218?si=ug0LzKtKIFv8XZKS).
- With the crisp clarity of space telescopes, we can now capture incredible images of so-called "[gravitational lenses](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220705.html)", which show how the gravity of a nearby galaxy can distort and bend the light from more distant galaxies. Here's [another incredible example](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap220713.html) from the Webb telescope. 
- Review [24.4 Time in General Relativity](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/24-4-time-in-general-relativity) to explore how gravity affects the flow of time according to general relativity.
- Passing near a black hole has the surprising effect of slowing time for the traveller, allowing him/her to effectively time-travel into the future. This is not science fiction, but a direct result of general relativity. One of my favorite movies, Interstellar, uses this idea to tell a beautiful story about a space-traveling father and his daughter. Check out my video [The Science of Interstellar](https://youtu.be/4sTgFY39W4Y?si=id07MKKJrxXEkMSp) for a brief overview of all the ways that Interstellar got the science correct.
