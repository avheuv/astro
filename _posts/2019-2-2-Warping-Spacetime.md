title: Warping Spacetime
---

- Read [24.2 Spacetime and Gravity](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/24-2-spacetime-and-gravity) to understand how Einstein's equivalence principle leads to the concept of curved spacetime.
- One of the best analogies of General Relativity is that matter warps space-time and what we experience as “gravity” is simply the most natural (“straight-line”) path through this curved space. This is demonstrated beautifully in the [Gravity Visualization Demo](https://youtu.be/MTY1Kje0yLg) (you don’t have to watch the entire thing, although the whole first half is pretty cool).
- Explore [24.3 Tests of General Relativity](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/24-3-tests-of-general-relativity) to learn about experimental evidence supporting Einstein's general theory of relativity.
- Watch this excellent video, which describes [The eclipse photos that made Einstein famous](https://youtu.be/HLxvq_M4218?si=ug0LzKtKIFv8XZKS).
- Review [24.4 Time in General Relativity](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/24-4-time-in-general-relativity) to explore how gravity affects the flow of time according to general relativity.
