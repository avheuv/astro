title: A Tour of the Universe
---

- I’m guessing at some point you’ve learned a little about planets, the solar system, galaxies, and the universe - even if that’s just from watching Star Wars. One of the best summaries of the universe that I’ve ever seen comes from the 90’s animated series, Animaniacs. Watch the 2-min [“Yakko’s Universe” music video](https://storage.googleapis.com/avh-astro-videos/Yakkos_Universe.mp4) and see if you can keep up with all of the astronomy terms being used (used correctly, I might add).
- Read [1.6 A Tour of the Universe](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/1-6-a-tour-of-the-universe), which starts from our platform here on "Spaceship Earth" and zooms progressively outward to the solar system, the galaxy, and the universe itself.  
- Our universe covers an incomprehensible scale - from the very small to the very large. The classic demonstration of this scale is the [1977 Short Film “Powers of Ten.”](https://youtu.be/0fKBhvDjuy0) If, like me, you are somewhat allergic to any videos made prior to 1990, then you may prefer this [1996 “Powers of Ten” remake](https://youtu.be/44cv416bKP4), narrated by Morgan Freeman.
- For an interactive experience, spend some time exploring the [Nikon Universcale](https://www.nikon.com/about/sp/universcale/scale.htm), which allows you to move through factors of ten from subatomic particles up to the entire observable universe.
