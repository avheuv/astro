title: Exoplanets Everywhere
---

- Explore [21.5 Exoplanets Everywhere: What We Are Learning](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/21-5-exoplanets-everywhere-what-we-are-learning) to understand how the Kepler mission is expanding our knowledge of exoplanets, revealing that Earth-size planets may be the most common type in the Galaxy.
- I want to underline one quote from this section: "We estimate that there are about 30 billion Earth-size planets in our Galaxy. If we include the super-Earths too, then there could be one hundred billion in the whole Galaxy. This idea—that planets of roughly Earth’s size are so numerous—is surely one of the most important discoveries of modern astronomy." Remember that our galaxy is one of billions of galaxies in our observable universe. In other words, there could easily be over 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 earth-size planets in our universe.
- Watch this brief video showing the Eyes on Exoplanets tool from NASA. Then [check out the simulator for yourself.](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/eyes-on-exoplanets/#/)
- Review [21.6 New Perspectives on Planet Formation](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/21-6-new-perspectives-on-planet-formation) to learn about the diversity of exoplanets and how their discovery is reshaping our understanding of planet formation.
- Check out [exoplanets.nasa.gov](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/) to see the most up-to-date information about extrasolar planet discoveries. Check out [my brief video tour](https://youtu.be/mmQ7G8WfY0E) of the website, which shows you some of the highlights.
