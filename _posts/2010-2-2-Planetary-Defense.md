- In 2013, a 50-ft diameter meteor fell into the skies above Russia. Within a few hours, everyone in the world was watching [the incredible videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H5yvH8YGIU) of the streak of light it created while crashing to earth. Meteors hit the earth every single day, but most of them are only the size of a grain of sand, creating a brief "shooting star" in the sky as they burn up entirely in the atmosphere.
- Review [13.2 Asteroids and Planetary Defense](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/13-2-asteroids-and-planetary-defense) to understand the potential threat posed by near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and near-Earth objects (NEOs). Explore ongoing efforts, such as NASA's Spaceguard Survey, to detect and monitor these objects, as well as research into planetary defense technologies.
