- In 2013, a 50-ft diameter meteor fell into the skies above Russia. Within a few hours, everyone in the world was watching [the incredible videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H5yvH8YGIU) of the streak of light it created while crashing to earth. Meteors hit the earth every single day, but most of them are only the size of a grain of sand, creating a brief "shooting star" in the sky as they burn up entirely in the atmosphere.
- When larger rocks fall to the earth, the results can be devastating. In 2013, no one was killed by the falling meteor (although over a thousand people were injured by broken glass from the shock wave). But in 1908, a larger meteor hit Russia. It landed in a remote part of Siberia called Tunguska. If it had landed in a populated city, it could have killed thousands of people! Watch the video [The Tunguska Event](https://youtu.be/F7PX51IeMbU?si=K26L2gRnmV17vL61) to learn about this incredible meteor impact.
- Review [13.2 Asteroids and Planetary Defense](https://openstax.org/books/astronomy-2e/pages/13-2-asteroids-and-planetary-defense) to understand the potential threat posed by near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and near-Earth objects (NEOs). Explore ongoing efforts, such as NASA's Spaceguard Survey, to detect and monitor these objects, as well as research into planetary defense technologies.
